It is known that every finite irreducible Coxeter group, with the exception of H3,H4, and I2(m) for m≠2,3,4,6, can appear as the Weyl group of a crystallographic root system. The classification of semisimple Lie algebras proceeds via the classification of their root systems and is thus closely linked to the"
