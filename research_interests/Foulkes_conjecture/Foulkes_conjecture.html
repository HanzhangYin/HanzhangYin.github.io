    <h1>Weyl Group</h1>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Definition. }\)Let \(G\) be a compact simple Lie group with maximal abelian subgroup \(T\) and normalizer \(N(T)\).
      Then \(W=N(T) / T\) is a finite group called the Weyl group of \(G\).
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Definition. }\)A finite set \(\Phi \subset \mathbb{E}^d \backslash\{0\}\) is called a crystallographic root system if it spans \(\mathbb{E}^d\) and for all \(\alpha, \beta \in \Phi\), the following hold:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>\(\Phi \cap \mathbb{R} \alpha=\{\alpha,-\alpha\}\).</li>
        <li>\(\sigma_\alpha(\Phi)=\Phi\).</li>
        <li>\(\sigma_\alpha(\beta)\) is obtained from \(\beta\) by adding an integral multiple of \(\alpha\).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The group \(W\) generated by the reflections \(\sigma_\alpha, \alpha \in \Phi\), is called the Weyl group of \(\Phi\). It is (with a natural choice of generators) a Coxeter group. It is known that every finite irreducible Coxeter group, with the exception of \(H_3, H_4\), and \(I_2(m)\) for \(m \neq 2,3,4,6\), can appear as the Weyl group of a crystallographic root system. The classification of semisimple Lie algebras proceeds via the classification of their root systems and is thus closely linked to the classification of finite Coxeter groups.

  <section id = g_equivariant_map>
    <h2>\(G\)-equivariant Map</h2>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Definition. }\)Let \(G\) be a group and \(V, W\) finite dimensional \(G\)-representations. We say that a linear map \(f\) is \(G\)-equivariant if \(f(g * v)=g * f(v)\) forall \(v \in V, g \in G\).
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Remark. }\)The set of all \(G\)-equivariant maps from \(V\) to \(W\) is denoted by \(\text{Hom}_G(V,W)\).
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id = 'linear_functional'>
    <h2>Linear Functional</h2>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Definition (A linear functional). }\)A linear functional is a linear map from a vector space to its field of scalars.
      In mathematical terms, if \( V \) is a vector space over a field \( F \), a linear functional \( f: V \to F \) satisfies:
      \[
      f(ax + by) = af(x) + bf(y),
      \]
      for any vectors \( x, y \in V \) and scalars \( a, b \in F \).
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id = 'functor'>
    <h2>Functor</h2>
    <p>
      A functor is a concept in category theory that maps objects and morphisms from one category to another, preserving the structure of the categories.
      Specifically, a functor \(\mathcal{F}\) from a category \( \mathcal{C}\) to a category \(\mathcal{D}\) assigns to each object \(X\) in \(\mathcal{C}\) an object \(F(X)\) in \(\mathcal{D}\),
      and to each morphism \(f: X \to Y\) in \(\mathcal{C}\), a morphism \(\mathcal{F}(f): F(X) \to F(Y)\) in \(\mathcal{D}\).
      This assignment respects identity morphisms and composition, meaning that \(F(\text{id}_X) = \text{id}_{F(X)}\) and \(F(g \circ f) = F(g) \circ F(f)\).

  <section id = 'tensor_product_representation'>
    <h2>Tensor products of representations</h2>
    <p>
      Suppose \( \phi_1: G \rightarrow \mathrm{GL}\left(V_1\right) \) and \( \phi_2: G \rightarrow \mathrm{GL}\left(V_2\right) \) are representations of a group \( G \). Then we can form a representation \( \phi_1 \otimes \phi_2 \) of \( G \) acting on the tensor product vector space \( V_1 \otimes V_2 \) as follows:
      \[
      \left(\phi_1 \otimes \phi_2\right)(g) = \phi_1(g) \otimes \phi_2(g).
      \]
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id = 'symmetric_power'>
    <h2>Symmetric Power</h2>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Definition (Symmetric Multilinear Function). }\)A multilinear function \( f: U^{\times m} \rightarrow V \) is symmetric if
      \[
      f\left(\vec{v}_1, \ldots, \vec{v}_i, \ldots, \vec{v}_j, \ldots, \vec{v}_m\right) = f\left(\vec{v}_1, \ldots, \vec{v}_j, \ldots, \vec{v}_i, \ldots, \vec{v}_m\right)
      \]
      for any \( i \) and \( j \), and for any vectors \( \vec{v}_k \). In other words, for any \(\sigma\in S_m\), we have
      \[
      f\left(\vec{v}_{\sigma(1)}, \ldots, \vec{v}_{\sigma(m)}\right) = f\left(\vec{v}_1, \ldots, \vec{v}_m\right).
      \]
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Remark. }\)We use \( \text{Sym}\left(U^{\times m}, V\right) \) to denote the set of symmetric multilinear functions from \( U^{\times m} \) to \( V \).
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Definition (Symmetric Power). }\)
      The \( m^{\text{th}} \) symmetric power of \( V \), denoted \( \text{Sym}^m(V) \), is the quotient of \( V^{\otimes m} \) by the subspace which is generated by
      \[
      \vec{v}_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \vec{v}_i \otimes \cdots \otimes \vec{v}_j \otimes \cdots \otimes \vec{v}_m - \vec{v}_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \vec{v}_j \otimes \cdots \otimes \vec{v}_i \otimes \cdots \otimes \vec{v}_m
      \]
      where \( i \) and \( j \) and the vectors \( \vec{v}_k \) are arbitrary.
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Theorem. }\)Let \(\{ \vec{v}_1, \ldots, \vec{v}_m \} \) be a basis for \( V \). Then

      \[
      \{ \vec{v}_{i_1} \cdots \vec{v}_{i_n} \mid i_1 \leq \cdots \leq i_n \}
      \]

      is a basis for \( \text{Sym}^n(V) \).
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textit{Proof. }\)With no restrictions on the subscripts, we can see that \( \{ \vec{v}_{i_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes \vec{v}_{i_n} \} \) form a basis for \( V^{\otimes n} \), the image of these elements spans \( \text{Sym}^n(V) \) (this is equivalent to surjectivity). In the quotient \( \text{Sym}^n(V) \), we can rearrange terms arbitrarily.
      This lets us rearrange any element of the form \( \vec{v}_{i_1} \cdots \vec{v}_{i_n} \) into one in which the subscripts are in the desired order.

      For linear independence, we show that there are linear functionals which are non-zero on a chosen \( \vec{v}_{i_1} \cdots \vec{v}_{i_n} \) and zero on all others. This will show that these are linearly independent, by our usual arguments.

      We can define an equivalence relation on the basis for \( V^{\otimes n} \) by saying that two vectors are equivalent if their subscripts are just permutations of each other.

      In other words, two basis vectors are equivalent if they map to the same vector in \( \text{Sym}^n(V) \).
      The equivalence classes form a partition of the basis.
      It's also clear that a linear functional on \( V^{\otimes n} \) (so a multilinear functional) is symmetric if it takes the same value on equivalent vectors.
      Since linear functionals on \( V^{\otimes n} \) are determined by their values on a basis, we can easily define a linear functional on \( \text{Sym}^n(V) \) with the required property by considering the linear functional on \( V^{\otimes n} \) which takes value \(1\) on the equivalence class corresponding to our vector and takes value \(0\) on all other equivalence classes. \(\square\)
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Theorem. }\)For \(\text{Sym}^2 V\), we have that
      \[
      \chi_{\text{Sym}^2 V}(g)=\frac{1}{2}\left[\chi_V(g)^2+\chi_V\left(g^2\right)\right] .
      \]
      Note that this is compatible with the decomposition
      \[
      V \otimes V=\text{Sym}^2 V \oplus \wedge^2 V .
      \]

      For \( \lambda = (n) \), the representation \( S^\lambda \) of \( S_n \) is the one-dimensional \textit{trivial representation} \( \mathbb{I}_n \), i.e., the vector space \( \mathbb{C} \) with the action \( \sigma \cdot z = z \) for all \( \sigma \) in \( S_n \) and all \( z \) in \( \mathbb{C} \). The Schur module \( E^{(n)} \) is the \( n^{\text{th}} \) symmetric power \( \operatorname{Sym}^n E \), which is defined to be the quotient space of the tensor product \( E^{\otimes n} \) of \( E \) with itself \( n \) times, dividing by the subspace generated by all differences

      \[
      v_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes v_n - v_{\sigma(1)} \otimes \cdots \otimes v_{\sigma(n)}
      \]

      for \( v_i \) in \( E \) and \( \sigma \) in \( S_n \). The image of \( v_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes v_n \) in \( \operatorname{Sym}^n E \) is denoted \( v_1 \cdots v_n \). The map \( E^{\times n} \rightarrow \operatorname{Sym}^n E \) is multilinear and symmetric. The vector space \( \operatorname{Sym}^n E \) is determined by a universal property: for any vector space \( F \), and any map

      \[
      \varphi: E^{\times n} \rightarrow F
      \]

      that is multilinear and symmetric, there is a unique linear map

      \[
      \tilde{\varphi}: \operatorname{Sym}^n E \rightarrow F
      \]

      such that

      \[
      \varphi(v_1 \times \cdots \times v_n) = \tilde{\varphi}(v_1 \cdots v_n).

    <h2>Schur Module</h2>
    <p>
      Consider maps \( \varphi: E^{\times \lambda} \rightarrow F \) from \( E^{\times \lambda} \) to an \( R \)-module \( F \), satisfying the following three properties:
    </p>
      <ol type="1">
      <li>\( \varphi \) is \( R \)-multilinear.</li>
        <li>\( \varphi \) is alternating in the entries of any column of \( \lambda \).</li>
        <li>For any \( \mathbf{v} \) in \( E^{\times \lambda} \), \( \varphi(\mathbf{v}) = \sum \varphi(\mathbf{w}) \), where the sum is over all \( \mathbf{w} \) obtained from \( \mathbf{v} \) by an exchange between two given columns, with a given subset of boxes in the right chosen column.</li>
      </ol>
    <p>
      1. \( \varphi \) is \( R \)-multilinear.

      This means that if all the entries but one are fixed, then \( \varphi \) is \( R \)-linear in that entry.

      2. \( \varphi \) is alternating in the entries of any column of \( \lambda \).

      That is, \( \varphi \) vanishes whenever two entries in the same column are equal. Together with (1), this implies that \( \varphi(\mathbf{v}) = -\varphi\left(\mathbf{v}^{\prime}\right) \) if \( \mathbf{v}^{\prime} \) is obtained from \( \mathbf{v} \) by interchanging two entries in a column.

      3. For any \( \mathbf{v} \) in \( E^{\times \lambda} \), \( \varphi(\mathbf{v}) = \sum \varphi(\mathbf{w}) \), where the sum is over all \( \mathbf{w} \) obtained from \( \mathbf{v} \) by an exchange between two given columns, with a given subset of boxes in the right chosen column.

    \(\textbf{Foulke's Conjecture.}\) Let \(a, b \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}\) with \(a \leq b\).

    the multiplicity of the irreducible \(\text{GL}(V)\) representation \(\{\lambda\}\) in the plethysm
    \(\text{Sym}^a \text{Sym}^b V\) is at most as large as

      \(\textbf{Remark. }\)We know that \(\text{Sym}^a \text{Sym}^b V\)

      but \(\text{Sym}^b \text{Sym}^a V\) contains irreducible \(\text{GL}(V)\) representations \(\{\lambda\}\) for which the Young diagram of \(\lambda\) has up to \(b\) rows.
