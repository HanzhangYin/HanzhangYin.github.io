      Projective space over \(\mathbb{Q}\), denoted \(\mathbb{P}^n(\mathbb{Q})\), is defined as
\[
\mathbb{P}^n(\mathbb{Q}) = (\mathbb{A}^{n+1}(\mathbb{Q}) - \{(0, \ldots, 0)\}) / \sim,

where \((x_0, \ldots, x_n) \sim (y_0, \ldots, y_n)\) if and only if there is some \(\lambda \in \mathbb{Q}\) such that \(x_i = \lambda y_i\) for all \(i\), \(0 \leq i \leq n\).
Projective space points are written with brackets:
\[
[x_0, \ldots, x_n] \in \mathbb{P}^n(\mathbb{Q}).

This gives homogeneous coordinates for the point.

    The curve 
    \[
    D_z = \{(x,y,1)\in\mathbb{A}^2:\;f(x,y,1) = 0\}
    \]
    is the affine part of porjective curve \(D\) where

    D = \{(x,y,z)\in\mathbb{P}^2:\;f(x,y,z) = 0\}. 
    \]
    The points on \(D\) in \(\mathbb{P}^1=\{[x, y, 0]\}\) are called the points at infinity of \(D\).
    THe curve \(D_Z:=D\cap\mathbb{A}^2\ with equation f(x,y,1)=0\) is called the affine part or dehomogenization of \(D\).

<section id = "homogenization">
  <h2>Homogenization</h2>
  <p>
    \(\textbf{Definition. }\)If \(C : f(x, y) = 0\) is an affine curve, the projective closure or homogenization of \(C\) is the projective curve \(D : F(X,Y,Z) = 0\) with just enough \(Z\)'s to make \(f\) homogeneous. 
  </p>
  <p>
    \(\textbf{Example. }\)\(f(x, y) = x^3+xy+y+1\) and \(F(X, Y, Z) = X^3+XYZ+YZ^2+Z^3\).

<section id = "singularity">
  Let \(C: f(x, y) = 0\) be an affine curve. Set
  \[
  \alpha = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0, y_0), \qquad \beta = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x_0, y_0).
  \]
  \(\textbf{Definition. }\)The tangent line to \(C\) at \((x_0, y_0)\) is 
  \[
  \alpha(x-x_0)+\beta(y-y_0) = 0.
  \]
  provided that at least one of \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0, y_0)\) and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x_0, y_0)\) is nonzero.
  \(\textbf{Definition. }\)If \(\alpha = \beta = 0\), then \((x_0, y_0)\) is a singular point or singularity of \(C\).
  \(\textbf{Definition. }\)
  \(\textbf{Example 1. }\)Let \(C\) to be 
  \[
  y^2 = 3x^3 - x. 
  \]
  Then
  \[
  f(x, y) = y^2 - 3x^3 + x.
  \]
  \[
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = -9x^2 + 1, \qquad \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 2y.
  \]
  For singular points, we have
  \[
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 0,
  \]
  which implies that \(x = \pm\frac{1}{3\sqrt{3}}\) and \(y = 0\).
  None of two is on \(C\), so \(C\) has no singular points.
  \(\textbf{Example 2. }\)Let \(C\) to be
  \[
  y^2 =x^3.
  \]
  Then
  \[
  f(x, y) = y^2 - x^3.
  \]
  \[
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = -3x^2, \qquad \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 2y.
  \]
  For singular points, we have
  \[
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 0,
  \]
  which implies that \(x = y = 0\).
  \(\textbf{Example 3. }\)Let \(C\) to be
  \[
  y^2 =x^3 + x^2.
  \]
  Then 
  \[
  f(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - x^2.
  \]
  \[
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = -3x^2 - 2x, \qquad \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 2y.
  \]
  For singular points, we have
  \[
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 0,
  \]
  which implies that \(x = y = 0\) and \(x = -\frac{2}{3}\). 
  \((0, 0)\) is a singulairty, but \((-\frac{2}{3}, 0)\) is not since it is not on \(C\).
  \(\textbf{Example 4. }\)Let \(C\) to be
  \[
  x^2 - y^2 = 3.
  \]
  We found that \(y = 2x - 3\) was tangent to \(C\) at \((2, 1)\).
  Then 
  \[
  f(x, y) = x^2 - y^2 - 3.
  \]
  \[
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2x, \qquad \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = -2y.
  \]
  For singular points, we have
  \[
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 0,
  \]
  which implies that \(x = y = 0\).
  \(\textbf{Example 5. }\)Let \(C\) to be
  \[
  x^2 - y^2 = 0.
  \]
  Then
  \[
  f(x, y) = x^2 - y^2.
  \]
  \[
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2x, \qquad \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = -2y.
  \]
  For singular points, we have
  \[
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 0,
  \]
  which implies that \(x = y = 0\) and \((0, 0)\) is on \(C\). Hence, it is a singularity.
  \(\textbf{Example 6. }\)Let \(C\) to be
  \[
  x^2 - y^2 = 1.
  \]
  Then
  \[
  f(x, y) = x^2 - y^2 - 1.
  \]
  \[
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2x, \qquad \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = -2y.
  \]
  For singular points, we have \((0, 0)\) is not on \(C\). Hence, it is not a singularity.

  <h2>Decomposition of Projective Curve</h2>
  <p>
    Let \(D: F(X, Y, Z)=0\) be a projective curve.
  </p>
  <p>
    \(\textbf{Example. }\)Let \(D\) be
    \[
    D: Y^2Z - X^3 - XZ^2 = 0.
    \]
    Let \(D_Z\) be the affine part of \(D\). Then
    \[

    \[
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = -3x^2 - 1, \qquad \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 2y.
    \]
    For singular points, we have
    \[
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 0,
    \]
    which implies that \(x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}\) and \(y = 0\).
    None of two is on \(D_Z\), so \(D_Z\) has no singular points.
    For points at infinity, we have
    \[
    F(X, Y, 0) = -X^3 = 0,
    \]
    which implies that \(X = 0\). Hence, the points at infinity are \([0, 1, 0]\).
    Thus, we can get a new line \(D_Y\)
    \[
    D_Y: Z - X^3 - XZ^2 = 0.

    We can get
