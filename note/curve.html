    The curve 
    \[
    D_z = \{(x,y,1)\in\mathbb{A}^2:\;f(x,y,1) = 0\}

    is the affine part of porjective curve \(D\) where

    \]
    The points on \(D\) in \(\mathbb{P}^1=\{[x, y, 0]\}\) are called the points at infinity of \(D\).
    THe curve \(D_Z:=D\cap\mathbb{A}^2\ with equation f(x,y,1)=0\) is called the affine part or dehomogenization of \(D\).

<section id = "homogenization">
  <h2>Homogenization</h2>
  <p>
    \(\textbf{Definition. }\)If \(C : f(x, y) = 0\) is an affine curve, the projective closure or homogenization of \(C\) is the projective curve \(D : F(X,Y,Z) = 0\) with just enough \(Z\)'s to make \(f\) homogeneous. 
  </p>
  <p>
    \(\textbf{Example. }\)\(f(x, y) = x^3+xy+y+1\) and \(F(X, Y, Z) = X^3+XYZ+YZ^2+Z^3\).

<section id = "singularity">
  Let \(C: f(x, y) = 0\) be an affine curve. Set
  \[
  \alpha = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0, y_0), \qquad \beta = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x_0, y_0).
  \]
  \(\textbf{Definition. }\)The tangent line to \(C\) at \((x_0, y_0)\) is 
  \[
  \alpha(x-x_0)+\beta(y-y_0) = 0.
  \]
  provided that at least one of \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0, y_0)\) and \(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}(x_0, y_0)\) is nonzero.
  \(\textbf{Definition. }\)If \(\alpha = \beta = 0\), then \((x_0, y_0)\) is a singular point or singularity of \(C\).
  \(\textbf{Definition. }\)
  \(\textbf{Example 1. }\)Let \(C\) to be 
  \[
  y^2 = 3x^3 - x. 
  \]
  Then
  \[
  f(x, y) = y^2 - 3x^3 + x.
  \]
  \[
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = -9x^2 + 1, \qquad \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 2y.
  \]
  For singular points, we have
  \[
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 0,
  \]
  which implies that \(x = \pm\frac{1}{3\sqrt{3}}\) and \(y = 0\).
  None of two is on \(C\), so \(C\) has no singular points.
  \(\textbf{Example 2. }\)Let \(C\) to be
  \[
  y^2 =x^3.
  \]
  Then
  \[
  f(x, y) = y^2 - x^3.
  \]
  \[
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = -3x^2, \qquad \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 2y.
  \]
  For singular points, we have
  \[
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 0,
  \]
  which implies that \(x = y = 0\).
  \(\textbf{Example 3. }\)Let \(C\) to be
  \[
  y^2 =x^3 + x^2.
  \]
  Then 
  \[
  f(x, y) = y^2 - x^3 - x^2.
  \]
  \[
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = -3x^2 - 2x, \qquad \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 2y.
  \]
  For singular points, we have
  \[
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 0,
  \]
  which implies that \(x = y = 0\) and \(x = -\frac{2}{3}\). 
  \((0, 0)\) is a singulairty, but \((-\frac{2}{3}, 0)\) is not since it is not on \(C\).
  \(\textbf{Example 4. }\)Let \(C\) to be
  \[
  x^2 - y^2 = 3.
  \]
  We found that \(y = 2x - 3\) was tangent to \(C\) at \((2, 1)\).
  Then 
  \[
  f(x, y) = x^2 - y^2 - 3.
  \]
  \[
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2x, \qquad \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = -2y.
  \]
  For singular points, we have
  \[
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 0,
  \]
  which implies that \(x = y = 0\).
  \(\textbf{Example 5. }\)Let \(C\) to be
  \[
  x^2 - y^2 = 0.
  \]
  Then
  \[
  f(x, y) = x^2 - y^2.
  \]
  \[
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2x, \qquad \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = -2y.
  \]
  For singular points, we have
  \[
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 0,
  \]
  which implies that \(x = y = 0\) and \((0, 0)\) is on \(C\). Hence, it is a singularity.
  \(\textbf{Example 6. }\)Let \(C\) to be
  \[
  x^2 - y^2 = 1.
  \]
  Then
  \[
  f(x, y) = x^2 - y^2 - 1.
  \]
  \[
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2x, \qquad \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = -2y.
  \]
  For singular points, we have \((0, 0)\) is not on \(C\). Hence, it is not a singularity.

    \]
    For singular points, we have
    \[
    \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 0,
    \]
    which implies that \(x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}\) and \(y = 0\).

    For points at infinity, we have

  <h2>Discriminant</h2>
  <p>
    \(\textbf{Definition. }\)Let \(E\) be an elliptic curve in Weierstrass:
    \[
    f(x) = x^3 + Ax^2 + Bx + C.
    \]
    The discriminant of \(E\) is
    \[
    \Delta = -4A^3C + A^2B^2 + 18ABC - 4B^3 - 27C^2.
    \]
  </p>
  <p>
    \(\textbf{Theorem. }\)Set 
    \[
    f(x) = x^3 + Ax^2 + Bx + C,
    \]
    with \(A, B, C\in\mathbb{Z}\), set 
    \[
    E: y^2 = f(x),
    \]
    and let \(D\) be the discriminant of \(f(x)\). Suppose 
    \(P = (x_0, y_0)\in E(\mathbb{Q})\) has finite order. Then 
    <ul>
      <li>\(x_0, y_0\in\mathbb{Z})</li>
      <li>Either \(y_0 = 0\) or \(y_0\;|\;D\)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    \(\textbf{Corollary: }\)\(E(\mathbb{Q})\) is finite.
  </p>
  <p>
    \(\textbf{Example. }\)Find all points of finite order on
    \[
    E: y^2 = x^3 + x^2 +3x - 1. 
    \]
    We first calculate the discriminant of \(E\):
    \[
    D = -171.
    \]
    Are there points with \(y_0 = 0\)? No.

  <h2>\(p\)-adic</h2>

    \(\textbf{Definition. }\)Let \(p\) be a prime number. The \( p \)-adic valuation is the function
