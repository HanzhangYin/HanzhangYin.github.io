      <h2>Field</h2>
      <h3>Division Ring</h3>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Definition. }\) A <strong>division ring</strong> is a ring \(R\) with identity \(1\) such that every nonzero element of \(R\) is a unit
        (i.e. every nonzero element of \(R\) has a multiplicative inverse).
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Definition. }\) A <strong>field</strong> is a commutative ring \(R\) with identity \(1\) such that every nonzero element of \(R\) is a unit
        (i.e. commutative division ring).
      </p>

    <br>

    <section id = 'ideal'>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proposition(1). }\) Let \(R\) be a ring with identity \(1\), and \(I\) is an ideal of \(R\). \(R = I\) if and only if \(I\) contains a unit. 
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof. }\)Firstly, suppose that \(R = I\). 
        Since \(R\) is a ring with identity \(1\), then we can know that \(1\) is unit in \(R\).
        Hence, we can see that \(I\) contains a unit.
        For the other direction, suppose that \(I\) contains a unit \(u\in R\).
        Then we can know that there exists an inverse \(u^{-1}\in R\) such that \(u^{-1}u = 1\).
        Hence, we have for any \(r\in R\), 
        \[
          r = r(1) = r(u^{-1}u) = (ru^{-1})(u)\in I.
        \]
        Therefore, we have \(R\subset I\). Since \(I\subset R\), we have \(R = I\). \(\blacksquare\)

    <section id = 'prime'>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Theorem. }\) Suppose that \(p\) is in a ring \(R\). Then \(p\) is prime if and only if \((p)\) is a prime ideal. 
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof. }\) We firstly show that if \(p\) is prime then \((p)\) is a prime ideal. Suppose that \(p\) is prime. 
        Then we have \(p\neq 0\) and \(p\) is not a unit. If \(p\mid ab\) where \(a, b\in R\), then we have \(ab = pr\) for some \(r\in R\).
        In other words, \(ab\in (p)\). Since \(p\) is prime, we have \(p\mid a\), which implies that \(a = pu\) for some \(u\in R\) (i.e. \(a\in (p)\)), 
        or \(p\mid b\), which implies that \(b = pv\) for some \(v\in R\) (i.e. \(b\in (p)\)). Therefore, we have \((p)\) is a prime ideal.
        For the other direction, we suppose that \((p)\) is a prime ideal. If \(ab\in (p)\) for some \(a, b\in R\), then we have \(ab = pr\) for some \(r\in R\).
        Since \((p)\) is a prime ideal, we have \(a\in (p)\) or \(b\in (p)\). Thus, we have \(p\mid a\) or \(p\mid b\). Therefore, \(p\) is prime. \(\blacksquare\)

        \(\textbf{Corollary. }\) If \(R\) is a field then any nonzero ring homomorphism \(\varphi: R\to S\) is injective.
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof. }\) Given \(R\) is a field, we can know that the only ideals of \(R\) are \(\{0\}\) and \(R\).
        We know that \(\ker(\varphi)\) is an ideal of \(R\). Thus, we only have two options, \(\ker(\varphi) = \{0\}\) or \(\ker(\varphi) = R\). 
        Suppose that \(a\in \ker(\varphi)\) where \(a\neq 0\). Since \(R\) is a field, we have \(a^{-1}\in R\). Then we have 
        \[
          0 = \varphi(a)\cdot \varphi(a^{-1}) = \varphi(aa^{-1}) = \varphi(1) = 1,
        \]
        which is a contradiction. Thus, we have \(\ker(\varphi) = \{0\}\). Therefore, \(\varphi\) is injective. \(\blacksquare\)

    <section id = 'integral_domain'>
    <h2>Integral Domain</h2>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Definition. }\) An integral domain is a commutative ring \(R\) with identity \(1\neq 0\) such that
      \[
        ab = 0 \implies a = 0 \text{ or } b = 0.
      \]
      (i.e. there is no zero divisors in \(R\)).
    </p>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>\(\textbf{Example 1. }\) \(\mathbb{Z}\) is an integral domain.</li>
        <li>\(\textbf{Example 2. }\) \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\) (Gaussian Integer) is an integral domain.</li>
        <p>
          \(\textbf{Proof (2).}\) The major part is to show that there is no zero divisor in \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\).
          Suppose that there exists zero divisors in \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\).
          Suppose \(a + bi, c + di\in \mathbb{Z}[i]\) such that \((a + bi)(c + di) = 0\), where 
          \(a\) or \(b\) is not zero and \(c\) or \(d\) is not zero. Then we have
          \[
            \begin{align} 
            (a + bi)(c + di) &= 0\\
            ac + adi + bci + bdi^2 &= 0\\
            ac - bd + (ad + bc)i &= 0\\
            ac - bd &= 0\\
            ad + bc &= 0\\
            ac &= bd\\
            ad &= -bc\\
            \end{align}
          \]
          Then we have 
          \[
          \begin{align}
            acd & = bd^2\\
            acd & = -bc^2\\
            bd^2 &= -bc^2\\
            d^2 &= -c^2\\
            d^2 + c^2 &= 0\\
          \end{align}
          \]
          Since \(d, c\in \mathbb{Z}\), we have \(d = c = 0\). However, we assume that \(c\) or \(d\) is not zero, which is a contradiction.

        <li>\(\textbf{Example 3. }\) Quadratic Integer Ring \(\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{D})\) is an integral domain</li>
        <li>\(\textbf{Example 4. }\) All fields are integral domains.</li>
        <li>\(\textbf{Claim 1. }\)\(2\) is irreducible in \(\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{-5})\)</li>
          <p>
            \(\textbf{Proof. }\) suppose that \(2 = (a + b\sqrt{-5})(c + d\sqrt{-5})\) for some \(a, b, c, d\in \mathbb{Z}\).
            Then we have
            \[
            \begin{align}
              2 &= (a + b\sqrt{-5})(c + d\sqrt{-5})\\
              2 &= ac - 5bd + (ad + bc)\sqrt{-5}\\
            \end{align}
            \]
            We can see that \(ad + bc = 0\). Then we have 
            \[
            \begin{align}
            2 &= ac - 5bd\\
            2 &= ac - 5bd - (ad + bc)\sqrt{-5}\\
            2 &= (a - b\sqrt{-5})(c + d\sqrt{-5})\\
            \end{align}
            \]
            In that case, we have 
            \[
            \begin{align}
            4 &= 2\cdot 2\\
            4 &= (a + b\sqrt{-5})(c + d\sqrt{-5})(a - b\sqrt{-5})(c + d\sqrt{-5})\\
            4 &= (a^2 + 5b^2)(c^2 + 5d^2)\\
            \end{align}
            \]
            Thus, we can see that if \(b\neq 0\), then we have \(a^2 + 5b^2 \geq 5\). 
            Similarly, if \(d\neq 0\), then we have \(c^2 + 5d^2 \geq 5\).
            Hence, we can see that \(b = d = 0\). Then we have \(2 = ac\).
            Since \(2\) is a prime number, we have \(a = 1\) and \(c = 2\).
            Therefore, we have \(2 = (2 + 0\sqrt{-5})(1 + 0\sqrt{-5})\), where one of them is a unit.
            Then, we have \(2\) is irreducible in \(\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{-5})\). \( \blacksquare\)

          <li>\(\textbf{Claim 2.}\) \(3\) is irreducible in \(\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{-5})\)</li>
          <p>
            \(\textbf{Proof. }\) To show that \(2\) is not a prime, we only need to come up with an example. 
            Firstly, we can see that \(6 = (1 + 5) = (1 + \sqrt{-5})(1 - \sqrt{-5})\). 
            Then we have \(2\mid 6\). However, we can see that \(2\nmid (1 + \sqrt{-5})\) and \(2\nmid (1 - \sqrt{-5})\).
            Therefore, we can see that \(2\) is not a prime in \(\mathbb{Z}(-\sqrt{5})\). \(\blacksquare\)
          </p>
          <li>\(\textbf{Claim 2.}\) \(2\) is not a prime in \(\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{-5})\)</li>

            Firstly, we can see that \(6 = (1 + 5) = (1 + \sqrt{-5})(1 - \sqrt{-5})\).

            Therefore, we can see that \(2\) is not a prime in \(\mathbb{Z}(-\sqrt{5})\). \(\blacksquare\)

          <li>\(\textbf{Claim 3.}\) \(3\) is not a prime in \(\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{-5})\)</li>
          <p>
            \(\textbf{Proof. }\) To show that \(3\) is not a prime, we come up with an example. 
            Firstly, we can see that \(3\cdot 3 = 9 = (2 + \sqrt{-5})(2 - \sqrt{-5})\). 
            Then we have \(3\mid 9\). However, we can see that \(3\nmid (2 + \sqrt{-5})\) and \(3\nmid (2 - \sqrt{-5})\).
            Therefore, we can see that \(3\) is not a prime in \(\mathbb{Z}(-\sqrt{5})\). \(\blacksquare\)
          </p>
          <li>\(\textbf{Claim 3.}\) \(2 + \sqrt{-5}\) is not a prime in \(\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{-5})\)</li>
          <p>
            \(\textbf{Proof. }\)We prove it with contradiction. Suppose that \(2+\sqrt{-5}\) is a prime. 
            We know that \(3\cdot 3 = 9 = (2 + \sqrt{-5})(2 - \sqrt{-5})\). 
            Then we have \(2+\sqrt{-5}\mid 9\), which implies that \(2 + \sqrt{-5}\mid 3\).
            We know that \(3\) is irreducible in \(\mathbb{Z}(-\sqrt{5})\). 
            Then \(2 + \sqrt{-5}\) is a unit, which is not true, or \(2 + \sqrt{-5}\) multiplied by a unit will be \(3\).
            There are only two units in \(\mathbb{Z}(-\sqrt{5})\), which are \(\pm 1\).
            However, \((2 + \sqrt{-5})\cdot 1 \neq 3\) and \(2 + \sqrt{-5}\cdot (-1) \neq 3\). 
            It is a contradiction. Therefore, we can see that \(2 + \sqrt{-5}\) is not a prime in \(\mathbb{Z}(-\sqrt{5})\). \(\blacksquare\)

        Suppose that \(p\) is a prime and \(p = ab\) for some \(a, b\in R\). Then we have \(p\mid ab\). Since \(p\) is prime, we have \(p\mid a\) or \(p\mid b\).

      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof. }\)Let \(R\) be a principal ideal domain and \((p)\) be a prime ideal in \(R\).
        Since \(R\) is a principal ideal domain, we find a ideal containing \((p)\) and assume it is \((m)\) (i.e. \((p)\subset (m)\)).
        Then we can know that \(p\in (m)\), which implies that \(p = mr\) for some \(r\in R\). 
        Then we can get \(mr\in (p)\). Since \(p\) is a prime ideal, we have \(m\in (p)\) or \(r\in (p)\).
        If \(m\in (p)\), then we have \((m)\subset (p)\). Since \((p)\subset (m)\), we have \((p) = (m)\).
        If \(r\in (p)\), then we have \(r = ps\) for some \(s\in R\). Then we have \(p =mr = psm\), which implies that \(1 = sm\).
        Hence, we have \(m\) is a unit in \(R\). Thus, we have \((m) = R\).

      <p>
        \(\textbf{Note. }\)If \(R\) is a Euclidean Domain, it means that \(R\) has some form of division algorithm.
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof. }\) Let \(I\) be an ideal in a Euclidean domain \(R\). We will show that there exists an element \(a \in I\) such that \(I = (a)\).
        Since the well ordering principle, we can choose \(a \in I\) such that \(a \neq 0\) and \(a\) has the smallest norm among all nonzero elements of \(I\). We claim that \(I = (a)\).
        Let \(x \in I\). We can write \(x = qa + r\), where \(q, r \in R\) and either \(r = 0\) or \(N(r) \lt N(a)\). 
        Since \(x \in I\) and \(a \in I\), we have \(qa + r \in I\). Therefore, \(r \in I\).
        If \(r = 0\), then \(x = qa \in (a)\). If \(r \neq 0\), then \(N(r) \lt N(a)\). 
        This contradicts the choice of \(a\). Therefore, \(r = 0\) and \(x = qa \in (a)\).
        Hence, every element of \(I\) can be written as a multiple of \(a\), so \(I = (a)\).
        Therefore, every ideal in a Euclidean domain is generated by a single element, and hence a Euclidean domain is a principal ideal domain. \(\blacksquare\)

        \(\textbf{Theorem. }\) Let \(F\) be a field. The polynomial ring \(F[x]\) is a \(\textit{Euclidean Domain}\).
        Specifically, if \(a(x)\) and \(b(x)\) are two polynomials in \(F[x]\) with \(b(x)\) nonzero, then there are unique \(q(x)\) and \(r(x)\) in \(F[x]\) such that
        \[
          a(x) =q(x)b(x) +r(x)\qquad \text{with}\qquad r(x) = 0 \text{ or } \deg(r(x)) \lt \deg(b(x)).

      <p>
        \(\textbf{Theorem. }\) Let \(F\) be a field and \( f \in F[x_1, \ldots, x_n] \) be non-constant. 
        Then we say that \(F[X_1, \ldots, x_n]\) is a Unique Factorization Domain.
        Specifically, there are irreducible polynomials \( g_1, \ldots, g_r \in F[x_1, \ldots, x_n] \) such that
        \[ 
          f = g_1 \cdots g_r.

        Furthermore, if there is a second factorization of \( f \) into irreducible polynomials
        \[ 
          f = h_1 \cdots h_s, 
        \]
        then \( r = s \) and the \( h_i \)'s can be permuted so that each \( h_i \) is a constant multiple of \( g_i \).

        \(\textbf{Theorem. }\) Let \(F\) be a field and \( f, g \in F[x] \). Assume that \( g \) is nonzero.

          f = qg + r, \quad \text{where } r = 0 \text{ or } \deg(r) \lt \deg(g).

      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Definition. }\)To say that a field \( L \) contains \(\textit{all}\) roots of \( f \) means that \( f \) factors as
        \[ 
          f = a_0(x - \alpha_1) \cdots (x - \alpha_n), 
        \]
        where \( \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \in L \). When this happens, we say that \( f \) splits completely over \( L \).
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Theorem. }\) If \( F \) is a field and \( f \in F[x] \) is non-constant, then the following are equivalent:

          <li>
            The polynomial \( f \) is irreducible over \( F \).
          </li>
          <li>
            The ideal \( (f) = \{ fg \mid g \in F[x] \} \) is a maximal ideal.

      <h2>Adjoining Element</h2>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Definition.}\) The \(\textit{polynomial ring}\) in the variables \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) with coefficients in \( R \), denoted \( R[x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n] \), is defined inductively by
        \[ 
          R[x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n] = R[x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{n-1}][x_n].
        \]
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Adjoining Elements.}\) We next show how to describe some interesting subrings and subfields of a given extension \( F \subset L \). 
        Given \( \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \in L \), we define
        \[ 
          F[\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n] = \{ h(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) \mid h \in F[x_1, \ldots, x_n] \}. 
        \]
        Hence \( F[\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n] \) consists of all polynomial expressions in \( L \) that can be formed using \( \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \) with coefficients in \( F \). 
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Note. }\)Keep in mind that \(F[\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n]\) is a ring, not necessarily a field.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example let Let \(F = \mathbb{Q}\) and \(\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}]\) is not a field. 
        We know that \(1 + \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}\in \mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}]\). However, we can see that
        \(\frac{1}{1 + \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}}\) is not in \(\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}]\).
      </p> 
        Let
        \[ 
          F(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) = \left\{ \frac{\alpha}{\beta} \mid \alpha, \beta \in F[\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n], \beta \neq 0 \right\}. 
        \]
        Thus \( F(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) \) is the set of all rational expressions in the \( \alpha_i \) with coefficients in \( F \). 
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Lemma. }\)\( F(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) \) is the smallest subfield of the field \( L \) containing \( F \) and \( \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \).
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof. }\) Let \(L\) be a field containing \(F\) and \(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n\).
        Firstly, we show that \( F(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) \) is a subfield of \( L \). 

        Thus, to prove the lemma, we must show that if \( K \) is a subfield of \( L \) containing \( F \) and \( \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \), then \( F(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) \subseteq K \). 
        This is what "smallest" means in the statement of the lemma.
        Suppose that \( K \subseteq L \) contains \( F \) and \( \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \). 
        Since \( K \) is closed under multiplication and addition, it follows that \( p(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) \in K \) for any polynomial \( p \in F[x_1, \ldots, x_n] \). 
        This shows that \( F[\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n] \subseteq K \). Then \( F(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) \subseteq K \) follows immediately, since \( K \) is a field.
        Since \( F(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) \) is a subfield of \( L \) containing \( F \), we get extensions  
        \[ 
          F \subseteq F(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) \subseteq L. 
        \]
        We say that \( F(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) \) is obtained from \( F \) by adjoining \( \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \in L \).

      <h2>Separable</h2>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Definition. }\)A polynomial \(f\in F [x]\) is separable if it is non-constant and its roots
        in a splitting field are all simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Theorem. }\)A nonzero polynomial in \(K[X]\) is separable if and only if it is relatively
        prime to its derivative in \(K[X]\).
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof. }\)We firstly show that if a nonzero polynomial in \(K[X]\) is separable, then it is relatively prime to its derivative in \(K[X]\).
        Suppose that \(f(x)\in K[X]\) is separable, then we have \(f(x) = (x - \alpha)h(x)\) for some \(\alpha\) in the extension of \(K\). 
        Note that \((x - \alpha)\) is the distinct factor of \(f\) because of the definition of separable. 
        In other words, \(h(\alpha)\neq 0\).
        Then we have 
        \[
        \begin{align}
          f'(x) &= h(x) + (x - \alpha)h'(x). \\
          f'(\alpha) &= h(\alpha) + (\alpha - \alpha)h'(\alpha) = h(\alpha) \neq 0. \\
        \end{align} 
        \]
        In that case, we can know that \(f\) and \(f'\) do not share the same root, which implies that 
        they do not have the same factor. Hence, we have \(f\) and \(f'\) are relatively prime.
        For the other direction, we will prove it with contrapositive. 
        Suppose that \(f(x)\) is not separable, given the definition of separable, we can know that \(f(x)\) has a repeated roots.
        Then we have \(f(x) = (x - \alpha)^2h(x)\) for some \(\alpha\) in the extension of \(K\).
        Hence, we can get 
        \[
        \begin{align}
          f'(x) &= 2(x - \alpha)h(x) + (x - \alpha)^2h'(x)\\
          f'(\alpha) &= 2(\alpha - \alpha)h(\alpha) + (\alpha - \alpha)^2h'(\alpha) = 0. \\
        \end{align}
        \]
        Therefore, we can know that \(f\) and \(f'\) have some similar factor. Hence, we have \(f\) and \(f'\) are not relatively prime. \(\blacksquare\)
