                <b>1.</b> Let \(R\) be a commutative ring with unity. Let \(U(R)\) be the set of units in \(R\).

                (b) Let \(R = \mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^2)\). Show that \(U(R) \cong \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}_2\). Justify your
                answer carefully.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        <b>Proof (a).</b> Given that \(R\) is a commutative ring with unity and \(U(R)\) is the set of units in \(R\).
        Hence, we know that \(1\in U(R)\). For any \(a\in U(R)\), we have \(a\cdot a^{-1}\in U(R)\) where \(a^{-1}\in
        U(R)\) since \(a\) is a unit.
        For any \(a, b\in U(R)\), we can know that \(ab\in U(R)\) since \(b^{-1}, a^{-1}\in U(R)\) and \(b^{-1}a^{-1}\in
        U(R)\).
        Therefore, we can know that \(U(R)\) is a group under multiplication. \(\blacksquare\)
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Proof (b).</b> Firstly, we can know that \((x^2) = \{f\cdot x^2 \mid f\in \mathbb{Z}[x]\}\).
        Hence, let \(f = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1x + a_0\), where \(a_i\in \mathbb{Z}\).
        Hence, we have \(f\cdot x^2 = a_nx^{n+2} + a_{n-1}x^{n+1} + \cdots + a_1x^3 + a_0x^2\).
        Thus, we can know that \(R = \mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^2) = \{ax + b\,\mid\, a, b\in \mathbb{Z}\}\).
        Suppose that \(ax + b\in U(R)\), then we can know that there exists \(cx + d\in U(R)\) such that
        \((ax + b)(cx + d) = 1\). Hence, we have \(acx^2 + (ad + bc)x + bd = (ad + bc)x + bd = 1\), which implies that
        \(ad + bc = 0\) and \(bd = 1\).
        Since \(b, d\in \mathbb{Z}\), we can know that \(b = d = -1\) or \(b = d = 1\) in order to make sure \(bd = 1\).
        Hence, we have \(a + c = 0\), which implies that \(a = -c\).
        Hence, we can know that \(U(R) = \{ax + 1, bx - 1\,\mid\, a, b\in \mathbb{Z}\}\).
        Let \(\varphi: U(R) \to \mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}_2\) be a map such that \(\varphi(ax + 1) = (a, 0)\) and
        \(\varphi(bx - 1) = (b, 1)\).

                2. Recall that a splitting field for a polynomial \( f(x) \) over a field \( F \) is the smallest (in terms of
                degree) extension \( K \) of \( F \) such that \( f(x) \) factors completely in \( K[x] \). Let \( F =
                \mathbb{Z}_2 \).
            </p>
            <p>
                (a) Prove that \( K = F[t]/(t^3 + t + 1) \) is a field of order 8.
            </p>
            <p>
                (b) Prove that \( K \) is a splitting field for \( f(x) = x^7 - 1 \) over \( F \).
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        <b>Proof (a).</b> Firstly, we want to show that \(t^3 + t + 1\) is irreducible in \(F[t]\) by contradiction.
        Suppose that \(t^3 + t + 1 = (t + a)(t^2 + bt + c)\) for some \(a, b, c\in F\).
        Then we know that \(t^3 + t + 1\) has a root in \(F\), which is \(-a\).
        However, \(1^3 + 1 + 1 = 1\) and \(0^3 + 0 + 1 = 1\). Hence, we can know that \(t^3 + t + 1\) has no root in
        \(F\), which is a contradiction.
        Thus, we can know that \(t^3 + t + 1\) is irreducible in \(F[t]\). Hence, we have \(K = F[t]/(t^3 + t + 1)\) is a
        field.
        Hence, the element in \(K\) is of the form \(a + bt + ct^2\) where \(a, b, c\in F\).
        Each \(a, b, c\) has two choices, which implies that \(K\) has \(2^3 = 8\) elements. Therefore, we can know that
        \(K\) is a field of order 8. \(\blacksquare\)
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Proof (b).</b> Given that \(K\setminus\{0\}\) is a group of order \(7\) under multiplication. Thus, for any
        \(x\in K\setminus \{0\}\), we have
        \(x^7 = 1\).
        Since each element of \(K\setminus\{0\}\) is root of \(x^7 - 1\), we can conclude that \(K\) is a splitting field
        for \(f(x) = x^7 - 1\) over \(F\). \(\blacksquare\)

                <b>3.</b> Let \( G \) be a group and \( \text{Aut}(G) \) be the group of automorphisms of \( G \). Recall that
                for any \( c \in G \), we have an automorphism of \( G \) given by \( f_c(x) = c^{-1}xc \) (such an
                automorphism is called an inner automorphism of \( G \)). It is not hard to see that \( \text{Inn}(G) \), the
                collection of inner automorphisms of \( G \), is a subgroup of \( \text{Aut}(G) \).
            </p>
            <p>
                (a) Show that \( G/Z(G) \cong \text{Inn}(G) \). Here \( Z(G) \) is the center of \( G \).
            </p>
            <p>
                (b) Show that if \( \text{Aut}(G) \) is cyclic, then \( G \) is abelian.
            </p>
            <p>
                (c) Find all prime numbers \( p \) such that there is a finite group \( G \) with \( \text{Aut}(G) \cong
                \mathbb{Z}_p \). (Hint: show that if \( G \) is not \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \), then \( \text{Aut}(G) \) must have an
                element of order 2).
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        <b>Proof (a)</b> Firstly, we define a map \(\varphi: G\to \text{Inn}(G)\) such that
        \[
        \varphi(g) = f_g(x) = g^{-1}xg.
        \]
        Then, we can see that \(\varphi\) is well-defined since if \(g = h\in G\), then we will have \(g^{-1}xg =
        h^{-1}xh\).
        Now, we want to show that \(varphi\) is a group homomorphism. Suppose that \(g, h\in G\), then we have
        \[
        \varphi(h)\cdot \varphi(g) = \varphi(g)\circ\varphi(h) = f_g\circ f_h(x) = f_g(h^{-1}xh) = g^{-1}h^{-1}xhg =
        (hg)^{-1}x(hg) = f_{hg}(x) = \varphi(hg).
        \]
        Hence, we can know that \(\varphi\) is a group homomorphism. Since for any \(f_g(x)\in \text{Inn}(G)\), we have
        \(\varphi(g) = f_g(x)\), which implies that \(varphi\) is surjective.
        Now, we want to figure the kernel of \(\varphi\). In \(\text{Inn}(G)\), we can know that the identity of
        \(\text{Inn}(G)\) is \(f_e(x) = e^{-1}xe = x\).
        Hence, for any \(g\in \ker(\varphi)\), we have \(f_g(x) = g^{-1}xg = x\), which implies that \(g\in Z(G)\).
        In other direction, for any \(z\in Z(G)\), we have \(f_z(x) = z^{-1}xz = x\), which implies that \(z\in
        \ker(\varphi)\).
        Thus, we can know that \(\ker(\varphi) = Z(G)\). By the \(\textbf{First Isomorphism Theorem}\), we can know that
        \(G/Z(G) \cong \text{Inn}(G)\). \(\blacksquare\)
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Proof (b).</b> We know that if \(G\) is a cyclic group, any subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic. Since
        \(\text{Inn}(G)\) is a subgroup of \(\text{Aut}(G)\) and \(\text{Aut}(G)\) is cyclic, we can know that
        \(\text{Inn}(G)\) is cyclic.
        And we already showed that \(\text{Inn}(G)\} \cong G/Z(G)\). Hence, we can know that \(G/Z(G)\) is cyclic. Since
        \(G/Z(G)\) is cyclic, we can know that \(G/Z(G) = \langle aZ(G)\rangle\) for some \(a\in G\).
        Hence, for any \(g\in G\), we can know that \(gZ(G) = (aZ(G))^n = a^nZ(G)\) for some \(n\in \mathbb{Z}\).
        Thus, we have \(Z(G) = (a^{-1})^ngZ(G) = a^{-n}gZ(G)\), which implies that there exists \(z\in Z(G)\) such that
        \(a^{-n}g = z\).
        Hence, we have \(g = za^n = a^nz\) for some \(z\in Z(G)\) and \(n\in \mathbb{Z}\). Now, suppose that \(g =
        a^nz_1\) and \(h = a^mz_2\) for some \(n, m\in \mathbb{Z}\) and \(z_1, z_2\in Z(G)\).
        Then we have
        \[
        gh = a^nz_1a^mz_2 = (a^nz_1a^m)z_2 = z_2a^nz_1a^m = z_2a^na^mz_1 = z_2a^{n+m}z_1 = z_2a^ma^nz_1 = a^mz_2a^nz_1 =
        hg.
        \]
        Therefore, we can know that \(G\) is abelian. \(\blacksquare\)
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Solution (c).</b> Suppose that \(G\) is a finite group and there exists a prime \(p\) such that \(\text{Aut}(G)
        = \mathbb{Z}_p\).
        We know that \(\mathbb{Z}_p\) is a cyclic group. Based on part (b), we can know that \(G\) is an abelian group.
        Assume that \(G\neq \mathbb{Z}_2\).
        In that case, we can know there exists \(g\in G\) such that \(g^{-1}\neq g\).
        Now define \(\varphi: G\to G\) such that \(\varphi(g) = g^{-1}\). Firstly, we can see that \(\varphi\) is
        well-defined since if \(g = h\), we will have \(g^{-1} = h^{-1}\).
        Now, we want to show that \(\varphi\) is a group homomorphism. Suppose that \(g, h\in G\), then we have
        \[
        \varphi(h)\cdot \varphi(g) = \varphi(g)\circ\varphi(h) = g^{-1}\circ h^{-1} = (hg)^{-1} = (gh)^{-1} = \varphi(gh).
        \]
        Hence, we can know that \(\varphi\) is a group homomorphism. Suppose that \(\varphi(g) = \varphi(h)\), then we
        have \(g^{-1} = h^{-1}\), which implies that \(g = h\).
        It shows that \(\varphi\) is injective. Given that \(G\) is a finite group, we can know that \(\varphi\) is
        surjective by the \(\textbf{Pigeonhole Principle}\).
        It means that \(\varphi\) is an automorphism of \(G\). For any \(g\in G\), we have \(\varphi^{2}(g) = g\), which
        implies that \(\varphi\) has order of \(2\).
        Hence, we can know that \(2\mid |\mathbb{Z}_p| = p\). If \(p\neq 2\), we can know that it is impossible that
        \(2\mid p\) since \(p\) is a prime number.
        Hence, \(p\) has to be \(2\) when \(G\neq \mathbb{Z}_2\). Let \(G = \mathbb{Z}_3\). For any \(\varphi\in
        \text{Aut}(G)\), we have \(\varphi(0) = 0\), \(\varphi(1) = 1\) and \(\varphi(2) = 2\), which implies that
        \(\varphi\) is the identity automorphism.
        Besides that \(\psi\in \text{Aut}(G)\) such that \(\psi(0) = 0\), \(\psi(1) = 2\) and \(\psi(2) = 1\), which
        implies that \(\psi\) has order of \(2\).
        And those are the only automorphisms of \(\mathbb{Z}_3\), which means \(\text{Aut}(\mathbb{Z}_3) = \mathbb{Z}_2\).
        When \(G = \mathbb{Z}_2\), let \(\varphi\in \text{Aut}(G)\) such that \(\varphi(0) = 0\) and \(\varphi(1) = 1\).
        Then we have \(\varphi\) is the identity automorphism, and it is the only automorphism of \(\mathbb{Z}_2\). Same
        for \(G = \mathbb{Z}_1\).
        Thus, we can know that the only possible \(p\) is \(2\).

        </div>

    <p>
        <b>Proof.</b> Since the characteristic polynomial of \( A \) is \( \chi_A(x) = \det(xI - A) \), which is a
        polynomial of degree \( n \) with variable \( x \).
        And we know that \(\det(-A) = (-1)^n\det(A)\). Hence, we plug in \(x = 0\), we have
        \[
        (-1)^n\det(A) = \det(-A) = \det(0I - A).

        <b>Solution (a).</b> We will first find an orthogonal basis for \( W \). Let \( v_1 = x + x^2 \), \( v_2 = x^2 +
        x^3 \), \( v_3 = x^3 \), and \( v_4 = x^3 + x^4 \) by \(\textbf{Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization}\).
        We normalize \(v_1\) firstly and have
        \[
        u_1 = \dfrac{v_1}{\|v_1\| } = \dfrac{x + x^2}{\sqrt{\langle x + x^2, x + x^2 \rangle}} = \dfrac{x +
        x^2}{\sqrt{\int_0^1 (x + x^2)(x + x^2) \, dx}} = \dfrac{x + x^2}{\sqrt{\dfrac{31}{30}} = \sqrt{\dfrac{30}{31}}(x +
        x^2)}.
        \]
        Then we have
        \[
        \begin{align}
        u_2 &= v_2 - \langle v_2, u_1 \rangle u_1 \\
        &= x^2 + x^3 - \sqrt{\dfrac{30}{31}} \int_0^1 (x^2 + x^3)(x + x^2) \, dx (x + x^2)(\sqrt{\dfrac{30}{31}}) \\
        &= x^2 + x^3 - \dfrac{30}{31} \int_0^1 (x^2+x^3)(x + x^2) \, dx (x + x^2) \\
        &= -\frac{49}{62}x + x^3 - \dfrac{13}{62} x^2. \\
        u_3 &= v_3 - \langle v_3, u_1 \rangle u_1 - \langle v_3, u_2 \rangle u_2 \\
        \end{align}
