                <b>(a)</b> Let \( A \) denote the ring of continuous real-valued functions on the open unit interval \( (0, 1)

                    (iii) Is \( (0) \) a prime ideal?

            </ul>
            <p>
                (b) Is the ideal \( \langle 2, x^2 + x + 1 \rangle \) in \( \mathbb{Z}[x] \) a maximal ideal?
            </p>
            <p>
                (c) Is the ideal generated by the class of \( x \) in the quotient ring \( \mathbb{C}[x, y] / \langle xy

            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        <b>Solution (ii).</b> \(I_{1/2} \cap I_{\pi/4} = \{ f \in A \mid f(1/2) = 0 \text{ and } f(\pi/4) = 0 \}\), which
        is not a prime ideal.
        Let
        \[
        \begin{align}
        f(x) &= |x - 1/2|, \\
        g(x) &= |x - \pi/4|.
        \end{align}
        \]
        Thus, we can know that both \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) are continuous real function and
        Hence, we can know that \(f(x)\cdot g(x)\in I_{1/2} \cap I_{\pi/4}\), but \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) are not in
        \(I_{1/2}\cap I_{\pi/4}\).
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Solution (b).</b> \(\langle 2, x^2 + x + 1 \rangle\) is a maximal ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Proof.</b>Since \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) has division algorithm, we can know if \(p(x)\in \mathbb{Z}[x]\), then we
        have
        \[
        p(x) = q(x)(x^2 + x + 1) + r(x), \text{ where } \deg(r(x)) < \deg(x^2 + x + 1). \] In other words, \(r(x)=ax +
        b\), where \(a, b\in \mathbb{Z}\). Since \(2\in \langle 2, x^2 + x + 1\rangle\), we can know that \(r(x)=ax +
        b\) only has three possibilities: \(r(x)=0, r(x)=x, r(x)=1, r(x)=x+1\). Thus, we have \[ \mathbb{Z}[x]/\langle
        2, x^2 + x + 1\rangle=\{0, 1, x, x + 1\}. \] And \(x(x + 1)=x^2 + x=-1=1\), which implies that \(x\) and \(x +
        1\) are units. Thus, we can see that \(\langle 2, x^2 + x + 1\rangle\) is a maximal ideal. \(\blacksquare\) </p>
    <p>
        <b>Solution (c).</b> The ideal generated by the class of \(x\) in the quotient ring \(\mathbb{C}[x, y]/\langle
        xy\rangle\) is a prime ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Proof.</b> We can know that \(\mathbb{C}[x, y]/\langle xy\rangle = \{a_nx^n + \dots + a_1x + b_my^m + \dots
        + b_1y + c + \langle xy\rangle \mid a_i, b_j, c\in \mathbb{C}\}\).
        For \(\langle x\rangle\subset \mathbb{C}[x, y]/\langle xy\rangle\), we have
        \[
        \begin{align}
        \langle x \rangle + \langle xy \rangle &= \{x(a_nx^n + \dots + a_1x + b_my^m + \dots + b_1y + c) + \langle
        xy\rangle \mid a_i, b_j, c\in \mathbb{C}\}, \\
        &= \{a_nx^{n+1} + \dots + a_1x^2 + b_my^mx + \dots + b_1yx + cx + \langle xy\rangle \mid a_i, b_j, c\in
        \mathbb{C}\}, \\
        &= \{a_nx^{n+1} + \dots + a_1x^2 + cx + \langle xy\rangle \mid a_i, c\in \mathbb{C}\}, \\
        &= \{a_nx^{n} + \dots + a_1x + \langle xy\rangle \mid a_i\in \mathbb{C}\}.
        \end{align}
        \]
        Then, we denote \(R = \mathbb{C}[x, y]/\langle xy\rangle\).
        Thus, we have
        \[
        R/\langle x\rangle = \{b_my^m + b_{m-1}y^{m-1} + \dots b_1y + b_0 + \langle xy\rangle \mid b_i\in \mathbb{C}\}
        \cong \mathbb{C}[y].
        \]
        Since \(\mathbb{C}[y]\) is a PID, which is an integral domain. Hence, we can know that \(\langle x\rangle\) is
        a prime ideal.

                <b>3.</b> Let \( F = \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \) denote the field with two elements and set \( f(x) = x^5 + x^2
                + 1 \in F[x] \).
            </p>
            <p>
                (a) Show that \( f(x) \) is irreducible over \( F \).
            </p>
            <p>
                (b) Let \( \alpha \) be a root of \( f(x) \) in some larger field. Express the element \( \alpha \cdot
                (\alpha^4 + \alpha + 1)^{-1} \) in \( F(\alpha) \) as a polynomial in \( \alpha \) over \( F \) of minimal
                degree.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        <b>Proof (a).</b> We will show that \(f(x)\) is irreducible over \(F\) by contradiction. Suppose that \(f(x)\) is
        reducible over \(F\).
        Then we have two possibilities:
        \[
        \begin{align}
        f(x) &= (x + a)(x^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e),\\
        f(x) &= (x^2 + ax + b)(x^3 + cx^2 + dx + e).\\
        \end{align}
        \]
        For the first case, we can know that \(f(x)\) has a root in \(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\).
        However, \(f(0) = 0^5 + 0^2 + 1 = 1\) and \(f(1) = 1^5 + 1^2 + 1 = 1\), which implies that \(f(x)\) has no root in
        \(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\).
        Hence, it leaves us with the second case.
        Then we have
        \[
        \begin{align}
        f(x) &= (x^2 + ax + b)(x^3 + cx^2 + dx + e)\\
        &= x^5 + (a + c)x^4 + (b + ac + d)x^3 + (ad + bc + e)x^2 + (ae + bd)x + be.
        &= x^5 + x^2 + 1.
        \end{align}
        \]
        Then we have
        \[
        \begin{align}
        be &= 1, \\
        ae + bd &= 0, \\
        ad + bc + e &= 1, \\
        b + ac + d &= 0, \\
        a + c &= 0.
        \end{align}
        \]
        Since \(be = 1\), we can have \(b = e = 1\). Then we rewrite the above equations as
        \[
        \begin{align}
        a + c &= 0, \\
        1 + ac +d &= 0, \\
        ad + c + 1 &= 1, \\
        a + d &= 0.
        \end{align}
        \]
        Since \(a + c = 0\) and \(a, c\in \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\), we can know that \(a = e\). By the similar reason,
        since \(a + d = 0\), we have \(a = d\).
        Now, we can know that \(a = c = d\), and we replace \(c\) and \(d\) with \(a\) and get
        \[
        \begin{align}
        1 + a^2 + a &= 0, \\
        a^2 + a + 1 &= 1. \\
        \end{align}
        \]
        Now, we see that \(a^2 + a + 1 \neq a^2 + a + 1\), which is a contradiction. Therefore, we can conclude that
        \(f(x)\) is irreducible over \(F\). \(\blacksquare\)
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Solution (b).</b> Firstly, we know that \(\alpha^5 + \alpha^2 + 1 = 0\). Hence, we have
        \[
        \begin{align}
        \alpha^5 + \alpha^2 &= -1 = 1, \\
        \alpha(\alpha^4 + \alpha) &= 1. \\
        \end{align}
        \]
        Thus, we can \(\alpha^{-1} = \alpha^4 + \alpha\). Meanwhile, we have
        \[
        \begin{align}
        \alpha^5 + \alpha^2 + \alpha + 1 &= \alpha \\
        \alpha^5 + \alpha^2 + \alpha &= \alpha - 1 = \alpha + 1 \\
        \alpha(\alpha^4 + \alpha + 1) &= \alpha + 1 \\
        (\alpha^4 + \alpha + 1) &= \dfrac{\alpha + 1}{\alpha} \\
        (\alpha^4 + \alpha + 1)^{-1} &= \dfrac{\alpha}{\alpha + 1} = \alpha(\alpha + 1)^{-1} \\
        \end{align}
        \]
        It shows that we need to find \(\alpha(\alpha + 1)^{-1}\). Given that
        \[
        \begin{align}
        (\alpha + 1)(\alpha + 1) &= \alpha^2 + 2\alpha + 1 = \alpha^2 + 1 = \alpha^5 \\
        (\alpha + 1)\dfrac{\alpha + 1}{\alpha^5} &= (\alpha + 1)(\alpha + 1)(\alpha^5)^{-1} = 1.
        \end{align}
        \]
        Since we know that \(\alpha^{-1} = \alpha^4 + \alpha\), we have
        \[
        \begin{align}
        (\alpha^5)^{-1} &= (\alpha^{-1})^{5} \\
        &= (\alpha^4 + \alpha)^5 = \alpha^5(\alpha^3 + 1)^5 = (\alpha^2 + 1)\cdot (\alpha^3 + 1)^4\cdot (\alpha^3 + 1) \\
        &= (\alpha^2 + 1)(\alpha^3 + 1)(\alpha^3 + 1)^2(\alpha^3 + 1)^2 \\
        &= (\alpha^5 + \alpha^2 + \alpha^3 + 1)(\alpha^6 + 1)^2 \\
        &= (\alpha^3)(\alpha^{12} + 1) \\
        &= \alpha^3(\alpha^5\cdot \alpha^5\cdot \alpha^2 + 1) \\
        &= \alpha^3((\alpha^2 + 1)^2\cdot \alpha^2 + 1) \\
        &= \alpha^3(\alpha^6 + \alpha^2 + 1) \\
        &= \alpha^3(\alpha\cdot \alpha^5 + \alpha^2 + 1) \\
        &= \alpha^3(\alpha(\alpha^2 + 1) + \alpha^2 + 1) \\
        &= \alpha^3(\alpha^3 + \alpha^2 + \alpha + 1) \\
        &= \alpha^6 + \alpha^5 + \alpha^4 + \alpha^3 \\
        &= \alpha(\alpha^2 + 1) + \alpha^2 + 1 + \alpha^4 + \alpha^3 \\
        &= \alpha^3 + \alpha^2 + \alpha + 1 + \alpha^4 + \alpha^3 \\
        &= \alpha^4 + \alpha^2 + \alpha + 1 \\
        \end{align}
        \]
        Thus, we can know that
        \[
        \begin{align}
        (\alpha + 1)\cdot(\alpha^5)^{-1} &= (\alpha + 1)\cdot (\alpha^4 + \alpha^2 + \alpha + 1) \\
        &= \alpha^5 + \alpha^3 + \alpha^2 + \alpha + \alpha^4 + \alpha^2 + \alpha + 1 \\
        &= \alpha^4 + \alpha^3 + \alpha^2.
        \end{align}
        \]
        Hence, the inverse of \(\alpha + 1\) is \(\alpha^4 + \alpha^3 + \alpha^2 \).
        Now, we can know that
        \[
        \begin{align}
        (\alpha^4 + \alpha + 1)^{-1} &= \alpha(\alpha + 1)^{-1} = \alpha(\alpha^4 + \alpha^3 + \alpha^2) = \alpha^5 +
        \alpha^4 + \alpha^3 = \alpha^4 + \alpha^3 + \alpha^2 + 1.\\
        \alpha(\alpha^4 + \alpha + 1)^{-1} &= \alpha(\alpha^4 + \alpha^3 + \alpha^2 + 1) = \alpha^5 + \alpha^4 + \alpha^3
        + \alpha = \alpha^4 + \alpha^3 + \alpha^2 + \alpha + 1. \\
        \end{align}
        \]

                <b>4.</b> Let \( p > 0 \) be a prime number and set \( F := \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z} \), the field with \( p \)
                elements. Find the number of \( 2 \times 2 \) matrices with entries in \( F \) such that \( A^2 = I \).
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        <b>Solution.</b> Given that \(A^2 = I\), we have \(A^2 - I = 0\). Hence, we set \(f(x) = x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x +
        1)\). Then, we have \(f(A) = 0\).
        Thus, we can know that the minimal polynomial of \(A\), \(\mu_A(x)\), divides \(f(x)\). Hence, we have three
        possibilities: \(x - 1\) or \(x + 1\) or \(f(x)\).
        If the minimal polynomial of \(A\) is \(x - 1\), then we can have \(A - I = 0\), which means that \(A = I\).
        If the minimal polynomial of \(A\) is \(x + 1\), then we can have \(A + I = 0\), which means that \(A = -I = (p -
        1)I\).
        If \(p = 2\), then we can know that \(A = I\) is the solution for both case where \(\mu_A(x) = x - 1\) and
        \(\mu_A(x) = x + 1\).
        If \(\mu_A(x) = (x - 1)(x + 1)\), then we can know that \(\gcd(x - 1, x + 1) = 1\), when \(p>2\).
        Hence, we can have two eigenvalues, which are \(1\) and \(p - 1\). And \(F^2 = \ker(A - I) \oplus \ker(A + I)\).
        Then, we can know that \(A\) is diagonalizable over \(F\). Thus, we can write \(A = PDP^{-1}\), where
        \[
        D = \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 0 \\
        0 & p - 1 \\
        \end{bmatrix}.
        \]
        And \(P\) is an invertible matrix with entries in \(F\). Denote \(P = [\vec{v_1}, \vec{v_2}]\), where
        \(\vec{v_1}\) and \(\vec{v_2}\) are the eigenvectors of \(A\).
        Besides, that \(\vec{v_1}, \vec{v_2}\) should be independent. Hence, for \(\vec{v_1}\in F^2\), we can know that it
        cannot be \(0\). Thus, there are \(p^2 - 1\) choices for \(\vec{v_1}\).
        For \(\vec{v_2}\in F^2\), we can know that it cannot be a multiple of \(\vec{v_1}\). Hence, there are \(p^2 - p\)
        choices for \(\vec{v_2}\).
        Then, we will have \((p^2 - 1)(p^2 - p)\) choices for \(P\). Hence, the number of \(2 \times 2\) matrices with
        entries in \(F\) such that \(A^2 = I\) is \(2 + (p^2 - 1)(p^2 - p)\) when \(p > 2\).
        When \(p=2\), there is only one matrix, which is the identity one.
