                <b>Problem 5.</b> Suppose \( A \in \mathbb{C}^{m \times n} \) with \( m \geq n \).
            </p>
            <p>
                (a) Show that matrix \( A^*A \) is always Hermitian positive semi-definite.
            </p>
            <p>
                (b) Show that \( \|A^*A\|_2 = \|A\|_2^2 \).
            </p>
            <p>
                (c) Show that if \( \text{rank}(A) = n \) then \( A^*A \) is invertible and \( \|A(A^*A)^{-1}A^*\|_2 = 1 \).

            <p>
                (d) Let \( A^\dagger \in \mathbb{C}^{n \times m} \) be the pseudoinverse (the Moore-Penrose inverse) of matrix \( A \) and suppose that \( \text{rank}(A) = n \). Show that
                \[
                A^\dagger = (A^*A)^{-1}A^*.
                \]

        <b>Proof (a).</b> Let \(x\in \mathbb{C}^n\) and we denote \(Ax = y\in \mathbb{C}^m\). Then, we have
        \[
        x^*A^*Ax = (Ax)^*(Ax) = \|Ax\|_2^2 = \|y\|_2^2\geq 0,
        \]
        for any \(x\in \mathbb{R}^n\). Thus, we can know that \(A^*A\) is Hermitian positive semi-definite. \( \blacksquare \)
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Proof (b).</b> We denote the SVD of \(A\) as \(A = U\Sigma V^*\), where \(U\in \mathbb{C}^{m\times m}\) and \(V\in \mathbb{C}^{n\times n}\) are unitary matrices, and \(\Sigma\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}\) is a diagonal matrix with non-negative real numbers on the diagonal.
        Suppose that \(\Sigma_{1,1}\geq \Sigma_{2,2}\geq \cdots \geq \Sigma_{n,n} \geq 0\).
        Since the 2-norm of a matrix is the largest singular value of the matrix, we have \(\|A\|_2 = \Sigma_{1,1}\).
        Besides that, we can know that \(\Sigma_{1, 1}^2 \geq \Sigma_{2, 2}^2 \geq \cdots \geq \Sigma_{n, n}^2 \geq 0\).
        \[
        A^*A = V\Sigma^*U^*U\Sigma V^* = V\Sigma^*\Sigma V^* = V\Sigma\Sigma V^* = V\Sigma^2 V^*.
        \]
        Since \(\Sigma_{1, 1}^2\) is the \((1, 1)\)-entry of \(\Sigma^2\), we can know that \(\|\Sigma^2\|_2 = \Sigma_{1, 1}^2\).
        Then, we can get
        \[
        \|A^*A\|_2 = \|V\Sigma^2 V^*\|_2 = \|\Sigma^2\|_2 = \|\Sigma^2\|_2 = \Sigma_{1, 1}^2.
        \]
        Thus, we can know that
        \[
        \|A^*A\|_2 = \|A\|_2^2. \tag*{\(\blacksquare\)}
        \]
