        \(\textbf{Corollary. }\) If \(R\) is a field then any nonzero ring homomorphism \(\phi: R\to S\) is injective.
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof. }\) Given \(R\) is a field, we can know that the only ideals of \(R\) are \(\{0\}\) and \(R\).
        We know that \(\ker(f)\) is an ideal of \(R\). Thus, we only have two options, \(\ker(f) = \{0\}\) or \(\ker(f) = R\). 
        Suppose that \(a\in \ker(f)\) where \(a\neq 0\). Since \(R\) is a field, we have \(a^{-1}\in R\). Then we have 
        \[
          0 = f(a)\cdot f(a^{-1}) = f(aa^{-1}) = f(1) = 1,
        \]
        which is a contradiction. Thus, we have \(\ker(f) = \{0\}\). Therefore, \(f\) is injective. \(\blacksquare\)

    <h2>Integral Domain</h2>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Definition. }\) An integral domain is a commutative ring \(R\) with identity \(1\neq 0\) such that
      \[
        ab = 0 \implies a = 0 \text{ or } b = 0.
      \]
      (i.e. there is no zero divisors in \(R\)).
    </p>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>\(\textbf{Example 1. }\) \(\mathbb{Z}\) is an integral domain.</li>
        <li>\(\textbf{Example 2. }\) \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\) (Gaussian Integer) is an integral domain.</li>
        <p>
          \(\textbf{Proof (2).}\) The major part is to show that there is no zero divisor in \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\).
          Suppose that there exists zero divisors in \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\).
          Suppose \(a + bi, c + di\in \mathbb{Z}[i]\) such that \((a + bi)(c + di) = 0\), where 
          \(a\) or \(b\) is not zero and \(c\) or \(d\) is not zero. Then we have
          \[
            \begin{align} 
            (a + bi)(c + di) &= 0\\
            ac + adi + bci + bdi^2 &= 0\\
            ac - bd + (ad + bc)i &= 0\\
            ac - bd &= 0\\
            ad + bc &= 0\\
            ac &= bd\\
            ad &= -bc\\
            \end{align}
          \]
          Then we have 
          \[
          \begin{align}
            acd & = bd^2\\
            acd & = -bc^2\\
            bd^2 &= -bc^2\\
            d^2 &= -c^2\\
            d^2 + c^2 &= 0\\
          \end{align}
          \]
          Since \(d, c\in \mathbb{Z}\), we have \(d = c = 0\). However, we assume that \(c\) or \(d\) is not zero, which is a contradiction.
        </p>
        <li>\(\textbf{Example 3. }\) Quadratic Integer Ring \(\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{D})\) is an integral domain</li>
        <li>\(\textbf{Example 4. }\) All fields are integral domains.</li>
        <li>\(\textbf{Claim 1. }\)\(2\) is irreducible in \(\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{-5})\)</li>
          <p>
            \(\textbf{Proof. }\) suppose that \(2 = (a + b\sqrt{-5})(c + d\sqrt{-5})\) for some \(a, b, c, d\in \mathbb{Z}\).
            Then we have
            \[
            \begin{align}
              2 &= (a + b\sqrt{-5})(c + d\sqrt{-5})\\
              2 &= ac - 5bd + (ad + bc)\sqrt{-5}\\
            \end{align}
            \]
            We can see that \(ad + bc = 0\). Then we have 
            \[
            \begin{align}
            2 &= ac - 5bd\\
            2 &= ac - 5bd - (ad + bc)\sqrt{-5}\\
            2 &= (a - b\sqrt{-5})(c + d\sqrt{-5})\\
            \end{align}
            \]
            In that case, we have 
            \[
            \begin{align}
            4 &= 2\cdot 2\\
            4 &= (a + b\sqrt{-5})(c + d\sqrt{-5})(a - b\sqrt{-5})(c + d\sqrt{-5})\\
            4 &= (a^2 + 5b^2)(c^2 + 5d^2)\\
            \end{align}
            \]
            Thus, we can see that if \(b\neq 0\), then we have \(a^2 + 5b^2 \geq 5\). 
            Similary, if \(d\neq 0\), then we have \(c^2 + 5d^2 \geq 5\).
            Hence, we can see that \(b = d = 0\). Then we have \(2 = ac\).
            Since \(2\) is a prime number, we have \(a = 1\) and \(c = 2\).
            Therefore, we have \(2 = (2 + 0\sqrt{-5})(1 + 0\sqrt{-5})\), where one of them is a unit.
            Then, we have \(2\) is irreducible in \(\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{-5})\).  \[ \tag*{$\square$} \]
          </p>
          <li>\(\textbf{Claim 2.}\) \(2\) is not a prime in \(\mathbb{Z}(-\sqrt{5})\)</li>
          <p>
            \(\textbf{Proof. }\) To show that \(2\) is not a prime, we only need to come up with an example. 
            Firstly, we can see that \(6 = (1 + 5) = (1 + \sqrt{-5})(1 - \sqrt{-5})\). 
            Then we have \(2\mid 6\). However, we can see that \(2\nmid (1 + \sqrt{-5})\) and \(2\nmid (1 - \sqrt{-5})\).
            Therefore, we can see that \(2\) is not a prime in \(\mathbb{Z}(-\sqrt{5})\). \[ \tag*{$\square$} \]

        \(\textbf{Problem 3. }\) Find the Jordan canonical form and a Jordan basis for
        \(
        A = \begin{pmatrix}
        2 & 2 & -1 \\
        0 & 3 & 0 \\
        1 & -2 & 4
        \end{pmatrix}.
        \)
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Solution. }\) Firstly, we calculate the characteristic polynomial
        \[
        \begin{align}
        \chi_A(x) &= \text{det}\left|
        \begin{matrix}
        x - 2 & 2 & 1\\
        0 & x-3 & 0\\
        -1 & x + 2 & x - 4\\
        \end{matrix} 
        \right|\\
        &= -(x-3)((x-2)(x-4) + 1)\\
        &= -(x-3)(x^2 - 6x + 9)\\
        &= - (x - 3)^3
        \end{align}
        \]
        Now we try to identity the minimal polynomial, which only have two options for us: \((x - 3)^2\) or \((x - 3)^3\).
        When we plug in \(A = x\) to \((x - 3)^2\), we have \((A - 3)^2 = 0\).
        Hence, we have the minimal polynomial which is \((x - 3)^2\).
        Hence, we have the rational canonical form and Jordan canonical form 
        \[
        R = \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & -9 & 0\\
        1 & 6 & 0\\
        0 & 0 & 3\\
        \end{pmatrix} \qquad
        J = \begin{pmatrix}
        3 & 0 & 0\\
        1 & 3 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 3\\
        \end{pmatrix} 
        \]
      Since the minimal polynomial is \((x - 3)^2\), we want to find a vector \(v\not\in \ker(A - 3)\) as a maximal vector. 
      We find out that \(v = (1, 0, 0)^T\), and we have the eigenvectors \((1, 0, -1)^T, (0, 1, 2)^T\). 
      We calculate the \(A\cdot v= (2, 0, 1)^T\). In order to make basis, we will choose \(v, Av\). For the last vector, we will use an 
      eigenvector which is linearly independent to \(v, Av\), which is \((0, 1, 2)^T\).
      Thus, the basis for the rational canonical form is 
      \[
      P_C = \begin{pmatrix} 
      1 & 2 & 0\\
      0 & 0 & 1\\
      0 & 1 & 2\\
      \end{pmatrix}
      \]
      Similary, we can find the Jordan basis 
      \[
      P_C = \begin{pmatrix} 
      1 & -1 & 0\\
      0 & 0 & 1\\
      0 & 1 & 2\\

      \(\textbf{Problem 1.}\) Suppose that \(A\) is a square complex matrix such that \(A\) is similar to \(A^n\), for some \(n>1\).
      Prove that the eigenvalues of \(A\) are either \(0\) or roots of unity. 
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof. }\) Suppose that \(\lambda\) is an eigenvalue of \(A\) and \(v\) is the corresponding eigenvector, and we
        want to show that \(\lambda^m\) is an eigenvalue for \(A^m\) for any \(m\in \mathbb{N}\). We can get
        \[
          \begin{align}
            A v &= \lambda v\\
            A^n v &= \lambda^n v\\
            A^{n^2} v &= \lambda^{n^2} v\\
            A (A^{m-1} v) &= \lambda A^{m-1} v\\
            &= A^{m-1}(\lambda v)\\
            &= \lambda A^{n-1}v\\
            &= \ldots \\
            &= \lambda^n v.
          \end{align}
        \]
        If \(A^n\) is similar to \(A\), then there exists an invertible matrix \(P\) such that \(A^n = P^{-1} A P\).
        We want to show that \(A\) is similar to \(A^{n^m}\) for any \(m\in \mathbb{N}\).
        \[
          \begin{align}
        A^{n^m} &= A^{nm}\\
        &= (P^{-1} A^n P)^{nm}\\
            &= (A^{n^{m-1}})^n\\
            &= (P^{-1} A^{n^{m-1}} P)^n\\
            &= P^{-1} A^{n^{m-1}} P P^{-1} A^{n^{m-1}} P \ldots P^{-1} A^{n^{m-1}} P\\
            &= P^{-1} A^{n^{m-1}} A^{n^{m-1}} \ldots A^{n^{m-1}} P\\
            &= P^{-1} A^{n^{m-1} + n^{m-1} + \ldots + n^{m-1}} P\\
            &= P^{-1} A^{n^m} P.
          \end{align}
        \]
        Hence, we can know that \(\lambda^n\) is an eigenvalue of \(A^n\) and its corresponding eigenvector is \(v\).
        Since we know that \(A\) and \(A^n\) are similar, we have \(\lambda^n\) is an eigenvalue of \(A\).

      \(\textbf{Problem 2.}\) Suppose \(A=
      \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & -1 & 3\\
        1 & -2 & 3\\
        0 & 0 & 2
        \end{pmatrix}
        \).  Calculate \(A^{2023}\).
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Solution. }\)We can get the characteristic polynomial of \(A\) is \(\chi_A(x)=(x - 2)(x+1)^2\).
      Now we need to find the minimal polynomial of \(A\). Given the characteristic polynomial of \(A\), we have two options
      for the minimal polynomial of \(A\), which are \((x-2)(x+1)\) and \((x-2)(x+1)^2\). Firstly, plug \(A\) into \((x-2)(x+1)\) and we have
      \[
        \begin{align}
          (A-2I)(A+I) &=
          \begin{pmatrix}
            -2 & -1 & 3\\
            1 & -4 & 3\\
            0 & 0 & 0
          \end{pmatrix}
          \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & -1 & 3\\
            1 & -1 & 3\\
            0 & 0 & 3
          \end{pmatrix}\\
          &=
          \begin{pmatrix}
            -3 & 3 & 0\\
            -3 & 3 & 0\\
            0 & 0 & 0
          \end{pmatrix} \\ 
          &\neq 0.
        \end{align}
      \]
      Then it leaves me the only option, which is \((x-2)(x+1)^2\). And we can know that the minimal polynomial 
      is the characteristic polynomial, which implies that there is only one Jordan block for the eigenvalue \(-1\).
      Now we can get the Jordan canonical form of \(A\), which is
      \[
        J = \begin{pmatrix}
          -1 & 0 & 0\\
          1 & -1 & 0\\
          0 & 0 & 2
        \end{pmatrix}.
      \]
      Now we need to find the matrix \(P\) such that \(A=PJP^{-1}\). 
      Firstly, we need to find the maximal vector of \(A\) for the eigenvalue \(-1\), which is in not in \(\ker(A + I)\).
      Then we get the columns of \(P\) as \(v, (A-2I)v = (1, 1, 0)^T, v_1\), where \(v_1\) is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(2\).
      Hence, we have 
      \[
        P = \begin{pmatrix}
          1 & 1 & 1\\
          0 & 1 & 1\\
          0 & 0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}.
      \]
      And we can get \(P^{-1}\) as follows:
      \[
        P^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix}
          1 & -1 & 0\\
          0 & 1 & -1\\
          0 & 0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}.
      \]
      Therefore, we have
      \[
    \begin{align}
      J &= P^{-1}AP = \begin{pmatrix}
        -1 & 0 & 0\\
        1 & -1 & 0\\
        0 & 0 & 2
      \end{pmatrix}. \\
      A^{2023} &= PJ^{2023}P^{-1}\\
      &= \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 1 & 1\\
        0 & 1 & 1\\
        0 & 0 & 1

      <li>(i) Define the adjoint of \( T \).</li>
      <li>(ii) Define what it means for \( T \) to be:
        <ul>
            <li>(a) self-adjoint</li>
            <li>(b) normal.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>(iii) Prove \( T \) is normal if and only if \( \|T(v)\| = \|T^*(v)\| \) for all \( v \in V \). Here, \( \|u\| \) denotes the length of the vector \( u \in V \).</li>
      <li>(iv) Give an example of a normal linear operator that is not self adjoint.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Solution (1). }\)The adjoint of \(T\) is the function \(T^*: V\to V\) such
      that
      \[
      \langle Tv, w\rangle = \langle v, T^* w\rangle
      \]
       for every \(v, w\in V\).
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Solution (2). }\)
      <ul>
        <li>(a) \(T\) is self-adjoint if \(T^*=T\).</li>
        <li>(b) \(T\) is normal if \(TT^*=T^*T\).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Proof (3). }\) Suppose that \(T\) is normal. Then we have \(TT^*=T^*T\).
      Let \(v\in V\). Then we have
      \[
        \begin{align}
          \langle T^*v, T^*v\rangle &= \langle TT^*v, v\rangle\\
          &= \langle T^*T v, v\rangle\\
        \end{align}.
      \]
      Since we know that \((T^*)^* = T\), then we can get that \(\langle T^*T v, v\rangle = \langle T v, T v\rangle\).
      Since we have \(\langle T^*v, T^*v\rangle = \langle T v, T v\rangle\), we can get \(\|T^*v\| = \|T v\|\).
      For the other direction, suppose that \(\|T^*v\| = \|T v\|\) for all \(v\in V\). Then we have
      \[
        \begin{align}
          \langle T^*v, T^*v\rangle &= \langle T v, T v\rangle\\
          \langle T^*v, T^*v\rangle &= \langle TT^*v, v\rangle\\
          \langle T v, T v\rangle &= \langle T^*T v, v\rangle\\
          \langle TT^*v, v\rangle &= \langle T^*T v, v\rangle\\
        \end{align}.
      \]
      Now, we have to show that \(TT^*=T^*T\). For all \(v\in V\), we have
      \[
        \begin{align}
          \langle TT^*v, v\rangle &= \langle T^*T v, v\rangle\\
          \langle TT^*v, v\rangle - \langle T^*T v, v\rangle &= 0\\
          \langle TT^*v - T^*T v, v\rangle &= 0\\
          \langle (TT^* - T^*T) v, v\rangle &= 0\\
        \end{align}.
      \]
      Since for all \(v\neq 0\), we have \(\langle (TT^* - T^*T) v, v\rangle = 0\), we can get \(TT^* - T^*T = 0\), which implies that \(TT^*=T^*T\).

    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Solution(1). }\) We say that \(p\) is irreducible if \(p = ab\) where \(a, b\in R\), then either \(a\) or \(b\) is a unit.
      We say that \(p\) is prime if \(p\) is not a unit and \(p\mid ab\) where \(a, b\in R\), then either \(p\mid a\) or \(p\mid b\).
    </p>
    <p>
          \(\textbf{Solution(2). }\)Firstly, we want to show that \(3\) is irreducible in \(\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{-11})\).
          Let \(3 = (a + b\sqrt{-11})(c + d\sqrt{-11})\). Then we have
          \[
            \begin{align}
            3 &= (a + b\sqrt{-11})(c + d\sqrt{-11})\\
            &= ac - 11bd + (ad + bc)\sqrt{-11}\\
            \end{align}.
          \]
          Thus, we have \(ac - 11bd = 3\) and \(ad + bc = 0\).
          Similary, we can have
          \[
            \begin{align}
            3 &= ac - 11bd - (ad + bc)\sqrt{-11}\\
            3 &= (a - b\sqrt{-11})(c - d\sqrt{-11})\\
            \end{align}.
          \]
          Then, we havve 
          \[
            9 = 3\cdot 3 = (a + b\sqrt{-11})(c + d\sqrt{-11})(a - b\sqrt{-11})(c - d\sqrt{-11}) = (a^2 + 11b^2)(c^2 + 11d^2).
          \]
          We can know that if \(b\neq 0\), then \(a^2 + 11b^2\geq 11\). Similary, if \(d\neq 0\), then \(c^2 + 11d^2\geq 11\).
          Now we can conclude that \(b = d = 0\), which implies that \((ac)^2 = 9\). Hence, we have \(ac = \pm 3\).
          Since \(a, c\in \mathbb{Z}\), we can get that, without loss of generality, \(a = -1\) and \(c = -3\) or \(a = 1\) and \(c = 3\).
          Then, we show that \(3 = (-1)(-3)\) or \(3 = (1)(3)\), which implies one of the divisors is a unit. 
          Hence, we can know that \(3\) is irreducible in \(\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{-11})\). \
          Then, we need to show that \(3\) is not prime in \(\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{-11})\).
          The first observation is that \(3\mid 12 = (1 + \sqrt{-11})(1 - \sqrt{-11})\).
          However, we can know that \(3\nmid (1 + \sqrt{-11})\) and \(3\nmid (1 - \sqrt{-11})\).
          Hence, we can know that \(3\) is not prime in \(\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{-11})\).
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Proof (3). }\) Suppose that \(R\) is an integral domain, and \(p\) is a prime in \(R\). 
      Then we can know that \((p)\) is a prime ideal in \(R\).
      If \((p)\) is a prime ideal, then for any \(a, b\in R\) such that \(p = ab\), we have \(a\in (p)\) or \(b\in (p)\) 
      according to the definition of prime ideal. Without loss of generality, we assume that \(a\in (p)\). 
      Then according to the definition of principal ideal, we have \(a = pr\) for some \(r\in R\).
      THen, we have \(p = ab= prb\), which implies that \(ar = 1\). Hence, we can know that \(a\) is a unit.
      In that case, we have for any \(ab = p\), either \(a\) or \(b\) is a unit. Therefore, we show that \(p\) is irreducible. \[ \tag*{$\square$} \]
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Proof (4). }\) Suppose that \(R\) is an principal ideal domain, and \(p\) is irreducible in \(R\).
      Let \(I\) to be any ideal containing \((p)\). Firstly, we can know that \(I\) is generated by some \(a\in R\) given 
      \(R\) is principal ideal domain. Then we have \(I = (a)\) and \((p)\subset (a)\). 
      Thus, we have \(p = ar\) for some \(r\in R\). Since \(p\) is irreducible, we have either \(a\) or \(r\) is a unit. 
      If \(a\) is a unit, then \((a)\) is a ideal containing a unit, which implies that \((a) = R\). If \(r\) is a unit, then
      there exists \(u\in R\) such that \(ru = 1\). Then we have 
      \[
      \begin{align} 
        p &= ar\\
        pu &= aru\\
        pu &= a\\
      \end{align}.
      \]
      Thus, we have \(a\in (p)\), which implies that \((a) = (p)\). Thus, we have the only ideals containing \((p)\) are \((p)\) and \(R\).
      Therefore, we show that \((p)\) is a maximal ideal. Since \(R\) is a principal ideal domain, we know that 
      \(R\) is an integral domain. Since every maximal domain is a prime ideal in an integral domain, we have \((p)\) is a prime ideal.
      Therefore, we have \(p\) is a prime in \(R\). \[ \tag*{$\square$} \]

      \(\textbf{K-State 2022(1)}\) Let \( H \) be a subgroup of a group \( G \). Consider the subgroup
          \[ L = \{ (h, h) \mid h \in H \} \]
          of \( H \times G \). Prove that \( L \) is a normal subgroup in \( H \times G \) if and only if \( H \) is contained in
        the center of \( G \).
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Proof. }\)Firstly, we show that \( L \) is a normal subgroup in \( H \times G \) if \( H \) is contained in the center of \( G \) (i.e. \(Z(G)\)).
      Suppose that \(H\subset Z(G)\). Let \((h,g)\in H\times G\) and \((h', h')\in L\). Then
      \[
        \begin{align}
          (h, g)(h', h')(h, g)^{-1} &= (h, g)(h', h')(h^{-1}, g^{-1})\\
          &= (h, g)(h'h^{-1}, h'g^{-1})\\
          &= (hh'h^{-1}, gh'g^{-1})\\
        \end{align}
      \]
      Since \(H\subset Z(G)\), we have \(ghg^{-1}=h\) for any \(g\in G\). Thus, we have
      \[
        (h, g)(h', h')(h, g)^{-1} = (hh'h^{-1}, hh'h^{-1}) = (h', h')\in L.
      \]
      Hence, we show that \(L\) is a normal subgroup in \(H\times G\).
      Now we show that if \(L\) is a normal subgroup in \(H\times G\), then \(H\subset Z(G)\).
      Suppose that \(L\) is a normal subgroup in \(H\times G\). Let \(h\in H\) and \(g\in G\). Then
      \[
        \begin{align}
          (h, g)(h_1, h_1)(h, g)^{-1} &= (h_2, h_2)\\
        \end{align}
      \]
      for some \(h_1, h_2\in H\). 
      Since \((e, g)\in H\times G\), we have
      \[
        \begin{align}
          (e, g)(h_1, h_1)(e, g)^{-1} &= (e, g)(h_1, h_1)(e, g^{-1})\\
          &= (eh_1e, gh_{1}g^{-1})\\
          &= (h_1, gh_1g^{-1})\\
          &= (h_2, h_2)\\
        \end{align}
      \]
      Hence, we can get \(h_1=h_2\). Thus, we have \(gh_1g^{-1}=h_1\) for any \(g\). 
      Therefore, we show that \(H\subset Z(G)\). \[ \tag*{$\square$} \]
