      <h2>Field</h2>
      <h3>Division Ring</h3>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Definition. }\) A <strong>division ring</strong> is a ring \(R\) with identity \(1\) such that every nonzero element of \(R\) is a unit
        (i.e. every nonzero element of \(R\) has a multiplicative inverse).
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Definition. }\) A <strong>field</strong> is a commutative ring \(R\) with identity \(1\) such that every nonzero element of \(R\) is a unit
        (i.e. commutative division ring).
      </p>
    </section>

    <br>

    <section id = 'ideal'>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proposition(1). }\) Let \(R\) be a ring with identity \(1\), and \(I\) is an ideal of \(R\). \(R = I\) if and only if \(I\) contains a unit. 
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof. }\)Firstly, suppose that \(R = I\). 
        Since \(R\) is a ring with identity \(1\), then we can know that \(1\) is unit in \(R\).
        Hence, we can see that \(I\) contains a unit.
        For the other direction, suppose that \(I\) contains a unit \(u\in R\).
        Then we can know that there exists an inverse \(u^{-1}\in R\) such that \(u^{-1}u = 1\).
        Hence, we have for any \(r\in R\), 
        \[
          r = r(1) = r(u^{-1}u) = (ru^{-1})(u)\in I.
        \]
        Therefore, we have \(R\subset I\). Since \(I\subset R\), we have \(R = I\). \(\blacksquare\)
      </p>
    </section>

    <br>

    <section id = 'prime'>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Theorem. }\) Suppose that \(p\) is in a ring \(R\). Then \(p\) is prime if and only if \((p)\) is a prime ideal. 
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof. }\) We firstly show that if \(p\) is prime then \((p)\) is a prime ideal. Suppose that \(p\) is prime. 
        Then we have \(p\neq 0\) and \(p\) is not a unit. If \(p\mid ab\) where \(a, b\in R\), then we have \(ab = pr\) for some \(r\in R\).
        In other words, \(ab\in (p)\). Since \(p\) is prime, we have \(p\mid a\), which implies that \(a = pu\) for some \(u\in R\) (i.e. \(a\in (p)\)), 
        or \(p\mid b\), which implies that \(b = pv\) for some \(v\in R\) (i.e. \(b\in (p)\)). Therefore, we have \((p)\) is a prime ideal.
        For the other direction, we suppose that \((p)\) is a prime ideal. If \(ab\in (p)\) for some \(a, b\in R\), then we have \(ab = pr\) for some \(r\in R\).
        Since \((p)\) is a prime ideal, we have \(a\in (p)\) or \(b\in (p)\). Thus, we have \(p\mid a\) or \(p\mid b\). Therefore, \(p\) is prime. \(\blacksquare\)
      </p>

    <section id = 'homomorphism'>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Corollary. }\) If \(R\) is a field then any nonzero ring homomorphism \(\varphi: R\to S\) is injective.
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof. }\) Given \(R\) is a field, we can know that the only ideals of \(R\) are \(\{0\}\) and \(R\).
        We know that \(\ker(\varphi)\) is an ideal of \(R\). Thus, we only have two options, \(\ker(\varphi) = \{0\}\) or \(\ker(\varphi) = R\). 
        Suppose that \(a\in \ker(\varphi)\) where \(a\neq 0\). Since \(R\) is a field, we have \(a^{-1}\in R\). Then we have 
        \[
          0 = \varphi(a)\cdot \varphi(a^{-1}) = \varphi(aa^{-1}) = \varphi(1) = 1,
        \]
        which is a contradiction. Thus, we have \(\ker(\varphi) = \{0\}\). Therefore, \(\varphi\) is injective. \(\blacksquare\)

    <section id = 'integral_domain'>
    <h2>Integral Domain</h2>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Definition. }\) An integral domain is a commutative ring \(R\) with identity \(1\neq 0\) such that
      \[
        ab = 0 \implies a = 0 \text{ or } b = 0.
      \]
      (i.e. there is no zero divisors in \(R\)).
    </p>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>\(\textbf{Example 1. }\) \(\mathbb{Z}\) is an integral domain.</li>
        <li>\(\textbf{Example 2. }\) \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\) (Gaussian Integer) is an integral domain.</li>
        <p>
          \(\textbf{Proof (2).}\) The major part is to show that there is no zero divisor in \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\).
          Suppose that there exists zero divisors in \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\).
          Suppose \(a + bi, c + di\in \mathbb{Z}[i]\) such that \((a + bi)(c + di) = 0\), where 
          \(a\) or \(b\) is not zero and \(c\) or \(d\) is not zero. Then we have
          \[
            \begin{align} 
            (a + bi)(c + di) &= 0\\
            ac + adi + bci + bdi^2 &= 0\\
            ac - bd + (ad + bc)i &= 0\\
            ac - bd &= 0\\
            ad + bc &= 0\\
            ac &= bd\\
            ad &= -bc\\
            \end{align}
          \]
          Then we have 
          \[
          \begin{align}
            acd & = bd^2\\
            acd & = -bc^2\\
            bd^2 &= -bc^2\\
            d^2 &= -c^2\\
            d^2 + c^2 &= 0\\
          \end{align}
          \]
          Since \(d, c\in \mathbb{Z}\), we have \(d = c = 0\). However, we assume that \(c\) or \(d\) is not zero, which is a contradiction.
        </p>
        <li>\(\textbf{Example 3. }\) Quadratic Integer Ring \(\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{D})\) is an integral domain</li>
        <li>\(\textbf{Example 4. }\) All fields are integral domains.</li>
        <li>\(\textbf{Claim 1. }\)\(2\) is irreducible in \(\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{-5})\)</li>
          <p>
            \(\textbf{Proof. }\) suppose that \(2 = (a + b\sqrt{-5})(c + d\sqrt{-5})\) for some \(a, b, c, d\in \mathbb{Z}\).
            Then we have
            \[
            \begin{align}
              2 &= (a + b\sqrt{-5})(c + d\sqrt{-5})\\
              2 &= ac - 5bd + (ad + bc)\sqrt{-5}\\
            \end{align}
            \]
            We can see that \(ad + bc = 0\). Then we have 
            \[
            \begin{align}
            2 &= ac - 5bd\\
            2 &= ac - 5bd - (ad + bc)\sqrt{-5}\\
            2 &= (a - b\sqrt{-5})(c + d\sqrt{-5})\\
            \end{align}
            \]
            In that case, we have 
            \[
            \begin{align}
            4 &= 2\cdot 2\\
            4 &= (a + b\sqrt{-5})(c + d\sqrt{-5})(a - b\sqrt{-5})(c + d\sqrt{-5})\\
            4 &= (a^2 + 5b^2)(c^2 + 5d^2)\\
            \end{align}
            \]
            Thus, we can see that if \(b\neq 0\), then we have \(a^2 + 5b^2 \geq 5\). 
            Similary, if \(d\neq 0\), then we have \(c^2 + 5d^2 \geq 5\).
            Hence, we can see that \(b = d = 0\). Then we have \(2 = ac\).
            Since \(2\) is a prime number, we have \(a = 1\) and \(c = 2\).
            Therefore, we have \(2 = (2 + 0\sqrt{-5})(1 + 0\sqrt{-5})\), where one of them is a unit.
            Then, we have \(2\) is irreducible in \(\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{-5})\). \( \blacksquare\) 
          </p>
          <li>\(\textbf{Claim 2.}\) \(2\) is not a prime in \(\mathbb{Z}(-\sqrt{5})\)</li>
          <p>
            \(\textbf{Proof. }\) To show that \(2\) is not a prime, we only need to come up with an example. 
            Firstly, we can see that \(6 = (1 + 5) = (1 + \sqrt{-5})(1 - \sqrt{-5})\). 
            Then we have \(2\mid 6\). However, we can see that \(2\nmid (1 + \sqrt{-5})\) and \(2\nmid (1 - \sqrt{-5})\).
            Therefore, we can see that \(2\) is not a prime in \(\mathbb{Z}(-\sqrt{5})\). \(\blacksquare\)

        \(\textbf{Theorem. }\) Let \(R\) be a principal ideal domain, then every prime ideal in \(R\) is maximal.
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof. }\)Let \(R\) be a principal ideal domain and \((p)\) be a prime ideal in \(R\).
        Since \(R\) is a principal ideal domain, we find a ideal containing \((p)\) and assume it is \((m)\) (i.e. \((p)\subset (m)\)).
        Then we can know that \(p\in (m)\), which implies that \(p = mr\) for some \(r\in R\). 
        Then we can get \(mr\in (p)\). Since \(p\) is a prime ideal, we have \(m\in (p)\) or \(r\in (p)\).
        If \(m\in (p)\), then we have \((m)\subset (p)\). Since \((p)\subset (m)\), we have \((p) = (m)\).
        If \(r\in (p)\), then we have \(r = ps\) for some \(s\in R\). Then we have \(p =mr = psm\), which implies that \(1 = sm\).
        Hence, we have \(m\) is a unit in \(R\). Thus, we have \((m) = R\). 
        Therefore, we can see that \((p)\) is maximal. \(\blacksquare\)

      <h2>Splitting Field</h2>
      <p>
        In abstract algebra, a splitting field of a polynomial \(p(x)\) over a field \(K\) is an extension field \(L\) of \(K\) such that \(f(x)\) factors into linear factors in \(L[x]\). 
        \[
        p(x) = (x - a_1)(x - a_2)\cdots(x - a_n).
        \]
        The splitting field of \(p(x)\) is the smallest field that contains all the roots of \(p(x)\). 
        It is also called the minimal splitting field of \(p(x)\).
        The existence of a splitting field for every polynomial over a field is a fundamental result in abstract algebra, known as the primitive element theorem. 
        This theorem states that every finite field extension is generated by a single element, called a primitive element. 
        It follows that every polynomial over a field has a splitting field, which can be constructed by adjoining a primitive element to the field.

          \(\textbf{Problem 1.}\)A square matrix \( A \) is called \(\textit{aperiodic}\) if \( A^m = A^n \) for some integers \( m > n \geq 0 \) (by convention \( A^0 = I \)).
        <ul>
            <li>
              Prove that a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix \( A \) over the real numbers is aperiodic if and only if: \( A^2 = \pm A \) or \( A^m = I \) for some \( m > 0 \).

        \(\textbf{Problem 3. }\) Find the Jordan canonical form and a Jordan basis for
        \(
        A = \begin{pmatrix}
        2 & 2 & -1 \\
        0 & 3 & 0 \\
        1 & -2 & 4
        \end{pmatrix}.
        \)
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Solution. }\) Firstly, we calculate the characteristic polynomial
        \[
        \begin{align}
        \chi_A(x) &= \text{det}\left|
        \begin{matrix}
        x - 2 & 2 & 1\\
        0 & x-3 & 0\\
        -1 & x + 2 & x - 4\\
        \end{matrix} 
        \right|\\
        &= -(x-3)((x-2)(x-4) + 1)\\
        &= -(x-3)(x^2 - 6x + 9)\\
        &= - (x - 3)^3
        \end{align}
        \]
        Now we try to identity the minimal polynomial, which only have two options for us: \((x - 3)^2\) or \((x - 3)^3\).
        When we plug in \(A = x\) to \((x - 3)^2\), we have \((A - 3)^2 = 0\).
        Hence, we have the minimal polynomial which is \((x - 3)^2\).
        Hence, we have the rational canonical form and Jordan canonical form 
        \[
        R = \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & -9 & 0\\
        1 & 6 & 0\\
        0 & 0 & 3\\
        \end{pmatrix} \qquad
        J = \begin{pmatrix}
        3 & 0 & 0\\
        1 & 3 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 3\\
        \end{pmatrix} 
        \]
      Since the minimal polynomial is \((x - 3)^2\), we want to find a vector \(v\not\in \ker(A - 3)\) as a maximal vector. 
      We find out that \(v = (1, 0, 0)^T\), and we have the eigenvectors \((1, 0, -1)^T, (0, 1, 2)^T\). 
      We calculate the \(A\cdot v= (2, 0, 1)^T\). In order to make basis, we will choose \(v, Av\). For the last vector, we will use an 
      eigenvector which is linearly independent to \(v, Av\), which is \((0, 1, 2)^T\).
      Thus, the basis for the rational canonical form is 
      \[
      P_C = \begin{pmatrix} 
      1 & 2 & 0\\
      0 & 0 & 1\\
      0 & 1 & 2\\
      \end{pmatrix}
      \]
      Similary, we can find the Jordan basis 
      \[
      P_C = \begin{pmatrix} 
      1 & -1 & 0\\
      0 & 0 & 1\\
      0 & 1 & 2\\
      \end{pmatrix}

          \begin{align}
            A v &= \lambda v\\
            A^n v &= \lambda^n v\\
            A^{n^2} v &= \lambda^{n^2} v\\
            A (A^{m-1} v) &= \lambda A^{m-1} v\\
            &= A^{m-1}(\lambda v)\\
            &= \lambda A^{n-1}v\\
            &= \ldots \\
            &= \lambda^n v.
          \end{align}
        \]
        If \(A^n\) is similar to \(A\), then there exists an invertible matrix \(P\) such that \(A^n = P^{-1} A P\).
        We want to show that \(A\) is similar to \(A^{n^m}\) for any \(m\in \mathbb{N}\).
        \[
          \begin{align}
        A^{n^m} &= A^{nm}\\
        &= (P^{-1} A^n P)^{nm}\\
            &= (A^{n^{m-1}})^n\\
            &= (P^{-1} A^{n^{m-1}} P)^n\\
            &= P^{-1} A^{n^{m-1}} P P^{-1} A^{n^{m-1}} P \ldots P^{-1} A^{n^{m-1}} P\\
            &= P^{-1} A^{n^{m-1}} A^{n^{m-1}} \ldots A^{n^{m-1}} P\\
            &= P^{-1} A^{n^{m-1} + n^{m-1} + \ldots + n^{m-1}} P\\
            &= P^{-1} A^{n^m} P.
          \end{align}
        \]
        Hence, we can know that \(\lambda^n\) is an eigenvalue of \(A^n\) and its corresponding eigenvector is \(v\).
        Since we know that \(A\) and \(A^n\) are similar, we have \(\lambda^n\) is an eigenvalue of \(A\).

      \(\textbf{Problem 2.}\) Suppose \(A=
      \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & -1 & 3\\
        1 & -2 & 3\\
        0 & 0 & 2
        \end{pmatrix}
        \).  Calculate \(A^{2023}\).
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Solution. }\)We can get the characteristic polynomial of \(A\) is \(\chi_A(x)=(x - 2)(x+1)^2\).
      Now we need to find the minimal polynomial of \(A\). Given the characteristic polynomial of \(A\), we have two options
      for the minimal polynomial of \(A\), which are \((x-2)(x+1)\) and \((x-2)(x+1)^2\). Firstly, plug \(A\) into \((x-2)(x+1)\) and we have
      \[
        \begin{align}
          (A-2I)(A+I) &=
          \begin{pmatrix}
            -2 & -1 & 3\\
            1 & -4 & 3\\
            0 & 0 & 0
          \end{pmatrix}
          \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & -1 & 3\\
            1 & -1 & 3\\
            0 & 0 & 3
          \end{pmatrix}\\
          &=
          \begin{pmatrix}
            -3 & 3 & 0\\
            -3 & 3 & 0\\
            0 & 0 & 0
          \end{pmatrix} \\ 
          &\neq 0.
        \end{align}
      \]
      Then it leaves me the only option, which is \((x-2)(x+1)^2\). And we can know that the minimal polynomial 
      is the characteristic polynomial, which implies that there is only one Jordan block for the eigenvalue \(-1\).
      Now we can get the Jordan canonical form of \(A\), which is
      \[
        J = \begin{pmatrix}
          -1 & 0 & 0\\
          1 & -1 & 0\\
          0 & 0 & 2
        \end{pmatrix}.
      \]
      Now we need to find the matrix \(P\) such that \(A=PJP^{-1}\). 
      Firstly, we need to find the maximal vector of \(A\) for the eigenvalue \(-1\), which is in not in \(\ker(A + I)\).
      Then we get the columns of \(P\) as \(v, (A-2I)v = (1, 1, 0)^T, v_1\), where \(v_1\) is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(2\).
      Hence, we have 
      \[
        P = \begin{pmatrix}
          1 & 1 & 1\\
          0 & 1 & 1\\
          0 & 0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}.
      \]
      And we can get \(P^{-1}\) as follows:
      \[
        P^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix}
          1 & -1 & 0\\
          0 & 1 & -1\\
          0 & 0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}.
      \]
      Therefore, we have
      \[
    \begin{align}
      J &= P^{-1}AP = \begin{pmatrix}
        -1 & 0 & 0\\
        1 & -1 & 0\\
        0 & 0 & 2
      \end{pmatrix}. \\
      A^{2023} &= PJ^{2023}P^{-1}\\
      &= \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 1 & 1\\
        0 & 1 & 1\\
        0 & 0 & 1

      <li>(iii) Prove \( T \) is normal if and only if \( \|T(v)\| = \|T^*(v)\| \) for all \( v \in V \). Here, \( \|u\| \) denotes the length of the vector \( u \in V \).</li>
      <li>(iv) Give an example of a normal linear operator that is not self adjoint.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Solution (1). }\)The adjoint of \(T\) is the function \(T^*: V\to V\) such
      that
      \[
      \langle Tv, w\rangle = \langle v, T^* w\rangle
      \]
       for every \(v, w\in V\).

      <ul>
        <li>(a) \(T\) is self-adjoint if \(T^*=T\).</li>
        <li>(b) \(T\) is normal if \(TT^*=T^*T\).</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Proof (3). }\) Suppose that \(T\) is normal. Then we have \(TT^*=T^*T\).
      Let \(v\in V\). Then we have
      \[
        \begin{align}
          \langle T^*v, T^*v\rangle &= \langle TT^*v, v\rangle\\
          &= \langle T^*T v, v\rangle\\
        \end{align}.
      \]
      Since we know that \((T^*)^* = T\), then we can get that \(\langle T^*T v, v\rangle = \langle T v, T v\rangle\).
      Since we have \(\langle T^*v, T^*v\rangle = \langle T v, T v\rangle\), we can get \(\|T^*v\| = \|T v\|\).
      For the other direction, suppose that \(\|T^*v\| = \|T v\|\) for all \(v\in V\). Then we have
      \[
        \begin{align}
          \langle T^*v, T^*v\rangle &= \langle T v, T v\rangle\\
          \langle T^*v, T^*v\rangle &= \langle TT^*v, v\rangle\\
          \langle T v, T v\rangle &= \langle T^*T v, v\rangle\\
          \langle TT^*v, v\rangle &= \langle T^*T v, v\rangle\\
        \end{align}.
      \]
      Now, we have to show that \(TT^*=T^*T\). For all \(v\in V\), we have
      \[
        \begin{align}
          \langle TT^*v, v\rangle &= \langle T^*T v, v\rangle\\
          \langle TT^*v, v\rangle - \langle T^*T v, v\rangle &= 0\\
          \langle TT^*v - T^*T v, v\rangle &= 0\\
          \langle (TT^* - T^*T) v, v\rangle &= 0\\
        \end{align}.
      \]
      Since for all \(v\neq 0\), we have \(\langle (TT^* - T^*T) v, v\rangle = 0\), we can get \(TT^* - T^*T = 0\), which implies that \(TT^*=T^*T\). \( \blacksquare \)

    <p>
      \(\textbf{Solution(1). }\) We say that \(p\) is irreducible if \(p = ab\) where \(a, b\in R\), then either \(a\) or \(b\) is a unit.
      We say that \(p\) is prime if \(p\) is not a unit and \(p\mid ab\) where \(a, b\in R\), then either \(p\mid a\) or \(p\mid b\).
    </p>
    <p>
          \(\textbf{Solution(2). }\)Firstly, we want to show that \(3\) is irreducible in \(\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{-11})\).
          Let \(3 = (a + b\sqrt{-11})(c + d\sqrt{-11})\). Then we have
          \[
            \begin{align}
            3 &= (a + b\sqrt{-11})(c + d\sqrt{-11})\\
            &= ac - 11bd + (ad + bc)\sqrt{-11}\\
            \end{align}.
          \]
          Thus, we have \(ac - 11bd = 3\) and \(ad + bc = 0\).
          Similary, we can have
          \[
            \begin{align}
            3 &= ac - 11bd - (ad + bc)\sqrt{-11}\\
            3 &= (a - b\sqrt{-11})(c - d\sqrt{-11})\\
            \end{align}.
          \]
          Then, we havve 
          \[
            9 = 3\cdot 3 = (a + b\sqrt{-11})(c + d\sqrt{-11})(a - b\sqrt{-11})(c - d\sqrt{-11}) = (a^2 + 11b^2)(c^2 + 11d^2).
          \]
          We can know that if \(b\neq 0\), then \(a^2 + 11b^2\geq 11\). Similary, if \(d\neq 0\), then \(c^2 + 11d^2\geq 11\).
          Now we can conclude that \(b = d = 0\), which implies that \((ac)^2 = 9\). Hence, we have \(ac = \pm 3\).
          Since \(a, c\in \mathbb{Z}\), we can get that, without loss of generality, \(a = -1\) and \(c = -3\) or \(a = 1\) and \(c = 3\).
          Then, we show that \(3 = (-1)(-3)\) or \(3 = (1)(3)\), which implies one of the divisors is a unit. 
          Hence, we can know that \(3\) is irreducible in \(\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{-11})\). \
          Then, we need to show that \(3\) is not prime in \(\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{-11})\).
          The first observation is that \(3\mid 12 = (1 + \sqrt{-11})(1 - \sqrt{-11})\).
          However, we can know that \(3\nmid (1 + \sqrt{-11})\) and \(3\nmid (1 - \sqrt{-11})\).
          Hence, we can know that \(3\) is not prime in \(\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{-11})\).
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Proof (3). }\) Suppose that \(R\) is an integral domain, and \(p\) is a prime in \(R\). 
      Then we can know that \((p)\) is a prime ideal in \(R\).
      If \((p)\) is a prime ideal, then for any \(a, b\in R\) such that \(p = ab\), we have \(a\in (p)\) or \(b\in (p)\) 
      according to the definition of prime ideal. Without loss of generality, we assume that \(a\in (p)\). 
      Then according to the definition of principal ideal, we have \(a = pr\) for some \(r\in R\).
      THen, we have \(p = ab= prb\), which implies that \(ar = 1\). Hence, we can know that \(a\) is a unit.
      In that case, we have for any \(ab = p\), either \(a\) or \(b\) is a unit. Therefore, we show that \(p\) is irreducible. \[ \tag*{$\square$} \]
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Proof (4). }\) Suppose that \(R\) is an principal ideal domain, and \(p\) is irreducible in \(R\).
      Let \(I\) to be any ideal containing \((p)\). Firstly, we can know that \(I\) is generated by some \(a\in R\) given 
      \(R\) is principal ideal domain. Then we have \(I = (a)\) and \((p)\subset (a)\). 
      Thus, we have \(p = ar\) for some \(r\in R\). Since \(p\) is irreducible, we have either \(a\) or \(r\) is a unit. 
      If \(a\) is a unit, then \((a)\) is a ideal containing a unit, which implies that \((a) = R\). If \(r\) is a unit, then
      there exists \(u\in R\) such that \(ru = 1\). Then we have 
      \[
      \begin{align} 
        p &= ar\\
        pu &= aru\\
        pu &= a\\
      \end{align}.
      \]
      Thus, we have \(a\in (p)\), which implies that \((a) = (p)\). Thus, we have the only ideals containing \((p)\) are \((p)\) and \(R\).
      Therefore, we show that \((p)\) is a maximal ideal. Since \(R\) is a principal ideal domain, we know that 
      \(R\) is an integral domain. Since every maximal domain is a prime ideal in an integral domain, we have \((p)\) is a prime ideal.
      Therefore, we have \(p\) is a prime in \(R\). \(\blacksquare\)

      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Solution(1). }\) Firstly, we need to find the roots of \(p(x)\). We can get the roots of \(p(x)\) as follows:
      \[
        \begin{align}
          p(x) &= x^4 - 4\\
          &= (x^2 - 2)(x^2 + 2)\\
          &= (x - \sqrt{2})(x + \sqrt{2})(x - i\sqrt{2})(x + i\sqrt{2}).
        \end{align}
      \]
      Then, we can know that the splitting field \(K\) of \(p(x)\) over \(\mathbb{Q}\) is \(K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, i)\).
      Firstly, we know that \([\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}): \mathbb{Q}]\) is 2 since \(x^2 - 2\) is irreducible in \(\mathbb{Q}\).
      \[
        [K: \mathbb{Q}] = [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, i): \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})][\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}): \mathbb{Q}]
      \]
      Since we can know that \(\mathbb{Q}\subset \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\), and we can know that \(x^2 + 1\) is irreducible in \(\mathbb{Q}[x]\) 
      by using the Eisenstein's criterion with \(p = 2\). Thus, we can know that \([\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, i): \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})] \leq 2\).
      Thus, we only have two options: the degree is either 1 or 2. If the degree is 1, then we have \(i\in\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\).
      Then we have \(i = a + b\sqrt{2}\) for some \(a, b\in\mathbb{Q}\). Then we have \(i^2 = -1 = (a + b\sqrt{2})^2\geq 0\), which is a contradiction.
      In that case, we can know that \([\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, i): \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})] = 2\). Therefore, we have 
      \[
        [K: \mathbb{Q}] = [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, i): \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})][\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}): \mathbb{Q}] = 2\cdot 2 = 4.
      \]
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Solution(2). }\)We need to determine \(\text{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})\). 
      Since we know that \(|\text{Gal}(K/\mathbb{Q})|\leq [K: \mathbb{Q}] = 4\).

      \]
      Since \(H\subset Z(G)\), we have \(ghg^{-1}=h\) for any \(g\in G\). Thus, we have
      \[
        (h, g)(h', h')(h, g)^{-1} = (hh'h^{-1}, hh'h^{-1}) = (h', h')\in L.
      \]
      Hence, we show that \(L\) is a normal subgroup in \(H\times G\).
      Now we show that if \(L\) is a normal subgroup in \(H\times G\), then \(H\subset Z(G)\).
      Suppose that \(L\) is a normal subgroup in \(H\times G\). Let \(h\in H\) and \(g\in G\). Then
      \[
        \begin{align}
          (h, g)(h_1, h_1)(h, g)^{-1} &= (h_2, h_2)\\
        \end{align}
      \]
      for some \(h_1, h_2\in H\). 
      Since \((e, g)\in H\times G\), we have
      \[
        \begin{align}
          (e, g)(h_1, h_1)(e, g)^{-1} &= (e, g)(h_1, h_1)(e, g^{-1})\\
          &= (eh_1e, gh_{1}g^{-1})\\
          &= (h_1, gh_1g^{-1})\\
          &= (h_2, h_2)\\
        \end{align}
      \]
      Hence, we can get \(h_1=h_2\). Thus, we have \(gh_1g^{-1}=h_1\) for any \(g\). 
      Therefore, we show that \(H\subset Z(G)\). \(\blacksquare\)

      Let \( R \) be a ring and \( M \) be a left \( R \)-module. For each element \( m \in M \), define
      \[
      \text{Ann}_R(m) = \{ r \in R \mid rm = 0 \}.
      \]
      Prove that \(\text{Ann}_R(m)\) is a left ideal of \( R \). 
      Give an example of \( R, M, \) and \( m \in M \) such that \(\text{Ann}_R(m)\) is not a right ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Proof. }\)Let \(r\in R \) and \(r'\in \text{Ann}_R(m)\). Then we have \(rr'\in \text{Ann}_R(m)\) since
      \[
        (rr')m = r(r'm) = r0 = 0.
      \]
      It shows that \(r\text{Ann}_R(m)\subset \text{Ann}_R(m)\) is a left ideal of \(R\).
