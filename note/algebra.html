        We say that \(H\) is a \(\textit{normal subgroup}\) of \(G\) if \(gH = Hg\) for all \(g\in G\).

        \(\textbf{Proposition. }\) Let \(\phi : G_1 \to G_2\) be a group homomorphism, with kernel \(K\). Then \(K\) is a normal subgroup of \(G_1\). Conversely, any normal subgroup of \(G_1\) is the kernel of a group homomorphism whose domain is \(G_1\). Thus, normal subgroups are exactly kernels of group homomorphisms.

      <p>
        \(\textbf{Theorem. }\)Let \(\phi : G_1 \to G_2\) be a surjective group homomorphism with kernel \(K\). Then there is a one-to-one, onto correspondence between the subgroups of \(G_1\) containing \(K\) and the subgroups of \(G_2\) given by \(H \mapsto \phi(H)\), for \(H \subseteq G_1\) containing \(K\), and \(L \mapsto \phi^{-1}(L)\), for \(L \subseteq G_2\). Under this correspondence, \(\phi(H)\) is normal in \(G_2\), if \(H\) is normal in \(G_1\) and \(\phi^{-1}(L)\) is normal in \(G_1\), if \(L\) is normal in \(G_2\).
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Corollary. }\) Let \( G \) be a group and \( N \) a normal subgroup. Then there is a one-to-one, onto correspondence between the subgroups of \( G \) containing \( N \) and the subgroups of \( G/N \). Under this correspondence, the normal subgroups of \( G \) containing \( N \) correspond to the normal subgroups of \( G/N \).
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Theorem. }\) Let \(G\) be a group and \(H \subseteq G\) a subgroup. Assume that \([G : H]\) is the smallest prime dividing the order of \(|G|\). Then \(H\) is normal in \(G\).

      </p>

        \(\textbf{LaGrange's Theorem.}\) Let \(G\) be a finite group and \(H \subseteq G\) a subgroup. Then
        \[
        |G| = |H| \cdot (\text{number of distinct left cosets of } H)\\

        \[
        \begin{align}
          (xy^{-1})a(xy^{-1})^{-1} &= x(y^{-1}ay)x^{-1}\\
          &= xax^{-1} \\
          &= a\in A.
        \end{align}
        \]
        Hence, we have \(xy^{-1}\in C_G(A)\). Therefore, \(C_G(A)\) is a subgroup of \(G\). \[ \tag*{\(\square\)} \]

      <p>
          <b>Theorem.</b> Let \(G\) be a group and \(H\) a normal subgroup. Then \(G\) is solvable if and only if \(H\) and \(G/H\) are solvable.
      </p>
      <p>
          <b>Proof.</b> Firstly, we want to show that if \(G\) is solvable, then we have \(H\) is solvable, and \(G/H\) is solvable.
          Given that \(G\) is solvable and \(H\) is normal. We can know that
          \[
            \{e\} = G_0\subset G_1\subset \dots G_r = G,
          \]
          where \(G_i\) is normal in \(G_{i+1}\) and \(G_{i+1}/G_i\) is abelian.
          Now, we define \(H_{i} = H\cap G_i\).
          Suppose that \(h'\in H_i\), we can know that for any \(h\in H_{i+1}\), we have \(h\cdot h'\cdot h^{-1}\in H\) since \(h, h', h^{-1}\in H\).
          At the same time, we can know that \(h\cdot h'\cdot h^{-1}\in G_i\), since \(h'\in G_i\) and \(G_i\) is normal in \(G_{i+1}\).
          Thus, we showed that \(h\cdot h'\cdot h^{-1}\in H\cap G_i = H_i\). Hence, we can know that \(H_i\) is normal in \(H_{i+1}\).
          Now, we define a map \(\varphi: H_{i+1}/H_i\to G_{i+1}/G_i\) such as
          \[
            \varphi(g\cdot H_i) = g\cdot G_i.
          \]
          Firstly, we want to show that the map is well-defined.
          Suppose that \(g\cdot H_i = h\cdot H_i\). Hence, we have \(h^{-1}\cdot g\in H_i\), which implies that \(h^{-1}g\in G_i\) for \(H_i\subset G_i\).
          Thus, we can know that \(h^{-1}g\cdot G_i \subset G_i\). Hence, for any \(g'\in G_i\) we have
          \[
            h^{-1}g\cdot g'\in G_i,
          \]
          which implies that
          \[
            g\cdot g'\in h\cdot G_i, \text{ for any }g'\in G_i.
          \]
          Thus, we have \(g\cdot G_i\subset h\cdot G_i\).
          Similarly, we can get \(g^{-1}h\in H_i\) from \(g\cdot H_i = h\cdot H_i\). Then, it shows that \(g^{-1}h\in G_i\), which implies that \(h\cdot G_i\subset g\cdot G_i\).
          Hence, we have \(g\cdot G_i = h\cdot G_i\) (i.e. \(\varphi(g\cdot H_i) = \varphi(h\cdot H_i)\)), and we showed the map is well-defined.
          Next, we need to show that \(\varphi\) is a homomorphism.
          Let \(g, h\in H_{i+1}\), we have
          \[
          \begin{align}
            \varphi(g\cdot H_i)\cdot \varphi(h\cdot H_i) &= g\cdot G_i\cdot h\cdot G_i = g\cdot hG_i, \\
            \varphi(gH_i\cdot hH_i) &= \varphi(g\cdot hH_i) = g\cdot hG_i.
          \end{align}
          \]
          Thus, we have \(\varphi(g\cdot H_i)\cdot \varphi(h\cdot H_i) = \varphi(gH_i\cdot hH_i)\).
          After that, we want to show that \(\varphi\) is injective.
          Suppose that \(\varphi(gH_i) = \varphi(hH_i)\) (i.e. \(gG_i = hG_i\)). Hence, we have \(h^{-1}g\in G_i\).
          Since \(h, g\in H\), we have \(h^{-1}g\in H\), which implies that \(h^{-1}g\in H_i\). Again, we can get \(gH_i\subset hH_i\).
          By the same process, we can get \(g^{-1}h\in G_i\), which will lead us to \(hH_i\subset gH_i\).
          Thus, \(gH_i = hH_i\). Hence, \(\varphi\) is injective. It allows us to know that \(\varphi(H_{i+1}/H_i)\) is a subgroup of \(G_{i+1}/G_i\).
          Since \(G_{i+1}/G_i\) is abelian by assumption, and \(H_{i+1}/H_i\cong \varphi(H_{i+1}/H_i)\subset G_{i+1}/G_i\), we can know that \(H_{i+1}/H_i\) is abelian for subgroup of an abelian group is abelian.
          Thus, we have
          \[
            \{e\} = \{e\}\cap H= H_0\subset H_1\subset \dots H_r = H\cap G,
          \]
          where each \(H_i\) is normal in \(H_{i+1}\) and \(H_{i+1}/H_i\) is abelian. Therefore, \(H\) is solvable.
        Now we need to show that \(G/H\) is solvable.
        We define \(K_i = G_i/H\) and want to show that \(K_i\) is normal in \(K_{i+1}\).
        Let \(gH\in K_{i+1}\) and \(g'H\in K_i\). We have
        \[
          (gH)(g'H)(gH)^{-1} = gHg'Hg^{-1}H = g g'g^{-1}H.
        \]
        Since \(G_i\) is normal in \(G_{i+1}\), we have \(g g'g^{-1}\in G_i\), which implies that \(g\cdot g'\cdot g^{-1}H \in G_i/H = K_i\).
        Hence, we show that \(K_i\) is normal in \(K_{i+1}\).
        Now, we need to show that \(K_{i+1}/K_i\) is abelian.
        If \(H\subset G_i\subset G_{i+1}\), we can know \(H\) is normal in \(G_i\) since \(H\) is normal in \(G\).
        By the Third Isomorphism Theorem, we have
        \[
           G_{i+1}/G_i\cong (G_{i+1}/H)/(G_i/H).
        \]
        Then, we have \((G_{i+1}/H)/(G_i/H)\) is abelian since \(G_{i+1}/G_i\) is abelian by assumption.
        (To be continued...)
        Now, suppose that \(H\) is a normal subgroup of \(G\), and \(H\) and \(G/H\) are solvable.
        We want to show that \(G\) is solvable. Since \(H\) is solvable, we have
        \[
        \{e\} = H_0\subset H_1\subset \dots H_n = H,
        \]
        where each \(H_i\) is normal in \(H_{i+1}\) and \(H_{i+1}/H_i\) is abelian.
        Since \(G/H\) is solvable, we have
        \[
        H \subset G_1/H\subset \dots \subset G_m/H = G/H,
        \]
        where \(H\subset G_i\) for all \(i\).
        Moreover, we have \(G_i/H\) is normal in \(G_{i+1}/H\) and \((G_{i+1}/H)/(G_i/H)\) is abelian.
        Since \(G_i/H\) is normal in \(G_{i+1}/H\), let \(g\in G_{i+1}\) and \(g'\in G_i\), we have
        \[
        \begin{align}
          (gH)(g'H)(gH)^{-1} &= gHg'Hg^{-1}H = g g'g^{-1}H\in G_i/H.
        \end{align}
        \]
        It shows that \(g g'g^{-1}\in G_i\), which implies that \(G_i\) is normal in \(G_{i+1}\).
        Since \((G_1/H)/H\cong G_1/H\), we have \(G_1/H\) is abelian.
        Thus, we can have a chain such as
        \[
        \{e\} = H_0\subset H_1\subset \dots H_n = H\subset G_1\subset \dots \subset G_m = G,
        \]
        where each \(H_i\) is normal in \(H_{i+1}\) and \(H_{i+1}/H_i\) is abelian, and each \(G_i\) is normal in \(G_{i+1}\) and \(G_{i+1}/G_i\) is abelian.
        Moreover, \(H\) is normal in \(G_1\) since \(H\) is normal in \(G\), and \(G_1/H\) is abelian.
        Therefore, we have \(G\) is solvable. \(\blacksquare\)

        \(\textbf{Proposition(1). }\) Let \(R\) be a ring with identity \(1\), and \(I\) is an ideal of \(R\). \(R = I\) if and only if \(I\) contains a unit.
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof. }\)Firstly, suppose that \(R = I\).
        Since \(R\) is a ring with identity \(1\), then we can know that \(1\) is unit in \(R\).
        Hence, we can see that \(I\) contains a unit.
        For the other direction, suppose that \(I\) contains a unit \(u\in R\).
        Then we can know that there exists an inverse \(u^{-1}\in R\) such that \(u^{-1}u = 1\).
        Hence, we have for any \(r\in R\),
        \[
          r = r(1) = r(u^{-1}u) = (ru^{-1})(u)\in I.
        \]

      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof. }\) We firstly show that if \(p\) is prime then \((p)\) is a prime ideal. Suppose that \(p\) is prime.
        Then we have \(p\neq 0\) and \(p\) is not a unit. If \(p\mid ab\) where \(a, b\in R\), then we have \(ab = pr\) for some \(r\in R\).
        In other words, \(ab\in (p)\). Since \(p\) is prime, we have \(p\mid a\), which implies that \(a = pu\) for some \(u\in R\) (i.e. \(a\in (p)\)),
        or \(p\mid b\), which implies that \(b = pv\) for some \(v\in R\) (i.e. \(b\in (p)\)). Therefore, we have \((p)\) is a prime ideal.
        For the other direction, we suppose that \((p)\) is a prime ideal. If \(ab\in (p)\) for some \(a, b\in R\), then we have \(ab = pr\) for some \(r\in R\).
        Since \((p)\) is a prime ideal, we have \(a\in (p)\) or \(b\in (p)\). Thus, we have \(p\mid a\) or \(p\mid b\). Therefore, \(p\) is prime. \(\blacksquare\)

          \(\textbf{Proof (2).}\) The major part is to show that there is no zero divisor in \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\).
          Suppose that there exists zero divisors in \(\mathbb{Z}[i]\).
          Suppose \(a + bi, c + di\in \mathbb{Z}[i]\) such that \((a + bi)(c + di) = 0\), where
          \(a\) or \(b\) is not zero and \(c\) or \(d\) is not zero. Then we have
          \[
            \begin{align}
            (a + bi)(c + di) &= 0\\
            ac + adi + bci + bdi^2 &= 0\\
            ac - bd + (ad + bc)i &= 0\\
            ac - bd &= 0\\
            ad + bc &= 0\\
            ac &= bd\\
            ad &= -bc\\
            \end{align}
          \]
          Then we have
          \[
          \begin{align}
            acd & = bd^2\\
            acd & = -bc^2\\
            bd^2 &= -bc^2\\
            d^2 &= -c^2\\
            d^2 + c^2 &= 0\\
          \end{align}
          \]
          Since \(d, c\in \mathbb{Z}\), we have \(d = c = 0\). However, we assume that \(c\) or \(d\) is not zero, which is a contradiction.

        <li>\(\textbf{Claim 1. }\)\(2\) is irreducible in \(\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{-5})\)</li>
      </ul>
          <p>
            \(\textbf{Proof. }\) suppose that \(2 = (a + b\sqrt{-5})(c + d\sqrt{-5})\) for some \(a, b, c, d\in \mathbb{Z}\).
            Then we have
            \[
            \begin{align}
              2 &= (a + b\sqrt{-5})(c + d\sqrt{-5})\\
              2 &= ac - 5bd + (ad + bc)\sqrt{-5}\\
            \end{align}
            \]
            We can see that \(ad + bc = 0\). Then we have
            \[
            \begin{align}
            2 &= ac - 5bd\\
            2 &= ac - 5bd - (ad + bc)\sqrt{-5}\\
            2 &= (a - b\sqrt{-5})(c + d\sqrt{-5})\\
            \end{align}
            \]
            In that case, we have
            \[
            \begin{align}
            4 &= 2\cdot 2\\
            4 &= (a + b\sqrt{-5})(c + d\sqrt{-5})(a - b\sqrt{-5})(c + d\sqrt{-5})\\
            4 &= (a^2 + 5b^2)(c^2 + 5d^2)\\
            \end{align}
            \]
            Thus, we can see that if \(b\neq 0\), then we have \(a^2 + 5b^2 \geq 5\).
            Similarly, if \(d\neq 0\), then we have \(c^2 + 5d^2 \geq 5\).
            Hence, we can see that \(b = d = 0\). Then we have \(2 = ac\).
            Since \(2\) is a prime number, we have \(a = 1\) and \(c = 2\).
            Therefore, we have \(2 = (2 + 0\sqrt{-5})(1 + 0\sqrt{-5})\), where one of them is a unit.
            Then, we have \(2\) is irreducible in \(\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{-5})\). \( \blacksquare\)

            \(\textbf{Proof. }\) To show that \(2\) is not a prime, we only need to come up with an example.
            Firstly, we can see that \(6 = (1 + 5) = (1 + \sqrt{-5})(1 - \sqrt{-5})\).
            Then we have \(2\mid 6\). However, we can see that \(2\nmid (1 + \sqrt{-5})\) and \(2\nmid (1 - \sqrt{-5})\).
            Therefore, we can see that \(2\) is not a prime in \(\mathbb{Z}(-\sqrt{5})\). \(\blacksquare\)

            \(\textbf{Proof. }\) To show that \(3\) is not a prime, we come up with an example.
            Firstly, we can see that \(3\cdot 3 = 9 = (2 + \sqrt{-5})(2 - \sqrt{-5})\).
            Then we have \(3\mid 9\). However, we can see that \(3\nmid (2 + \sqrt{-5})\) and \(3\nmid (2 - \sqrt{-5})\).
            Therefore, we can see that \(3\) is not a prime in \(\mathbb{Z}(-\sqrt{5})\). \(\blacksquare\)

        </ul>
          <p>
            \(\textbf{Proof. }\)We prove it with contradiction. Suppose that \(2+\sqrt{-5}\) is a prime.
            We know that \(3\cdot 3 = 9 = (2 + \sqrt{-5})(2 - \sqrt{-5})\).
            Then we have \(2+\sqrt{-5}\mid 9\), which implies that \(2 + \sqrt{-5}\mid 3\).
            We know that \(3\) is irreducible in \(\mathbb{Z}(-\sqrt{5})\).
            Then \(2 + \sqrt{-5}\) is a unit, which is not true, or \(2 + \sqrt{-5}\) multiplied by a unit will be \(3\).
            There are only two units in \(\mathbb{Z}(-\sqrt{5})\), which are \(\pm 1\).
            However, \((2 + \sqrt{-5})\cdot 1 \neq 3\) and \(2 + \sqrt{-5}\cdot (-1) \neq 3\).
            It is a contradiction. Therefore, we can see that \(2 + \sqrt{-5}\) is not a prime in \(\mathbb{Z}(-\sqrt{5})\). \(\blacksquare\)

        Suppose that \(p\) is a prime and \(p = ab\) for some \(a, b\in R\). Then we have \(p\mid ab\). Since \(p\) is prime, we have \(p\mid a\) or \(p\mid b\).

      <p>
        \(\textbf{Theorem. }\) Let \(R\) be a principal ideal domain, then every prime ideal in \(R\) is maximal.
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof. }\)Let \(R\) be a principal ideal domain and \((p)\) be a prime ideal in \(R\).
        Since \(R\) is a principal ideal domain, we find an ideal containing \((p)\) and assume it is \((m)\) (i.e. \((p)\subset (m)\)).
        Then we can know that \(p\in (m)\), which implies that \(p = mr\) for some \(r\in R\).
        Then we can get \(mr\in (p)\). Since \(p\) is a prime ideal, we have \(m\in (p)\) or \(r\in (p)\).
        If \(m\in (p)\), then we have \((m)\subset (p)\). Since \((p)\subset (m)\), we have \((p) = (m)\).
        If \(r\in (p)\), then we have \(r = ps\) for some \(s\in R\). Then we have \(p =mr = psm\), which implies that \(1 = sm\).
        Hence, we have \(m\) is a unit in \(R\). Thus, we have \((m) = R\).
        Therefore, we can see that \((p)\) is maximal. \(\blacksquare\)
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proposition. }\) Let \(R\) be a principal ideal domain. Then every irreducible element in \(R\) is prime.
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof. }\) Suppose that \(p\) is irreducible in \(R\).
        If \( M \) is any ideal containing \( \langle p\rangle  \) then by hypothesis \( M = \langle m\rangle  \) is a principal ideal.
        Since \( p \in \langle m\rangle  \), \( p = rm \) for some \( r \in R\).
        Since \(p\) is irreducible, either \( r \) or \( m \) is a unit.
        If \(m\) is a unit, we have \(\langle m\rangle = R\). If \(r\) is a unit, we have \(\langle p\rangle = \langle m\rangle \).
        Thus the only ideals of \(R\) containing \( \langle p\rangle  \) are \( \langle p\rangle \) or \( R \).
        Thus, we can know that \(\langle p\rangle \) is a maximal ideal.
        Since maximal ideals are prime ideals, we know that \(p\) is prime. \(\blacksquare\)

        \(\textbf{Proposition. }\)Any euclidean domain is a principal ideal domain.
      </p>

        \(\textbf{Note. }\)If \(R\) is a Euclidean Domain, it means that \(R\) has some form of division algorithm.
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof. }\) Let \(I\) be an ideal in a Euclidean domain \(R\). We will show that there exists an element \(a \in I\) such that \(I = (a)\).
        Since the well ordering principle, we can choose \(a \in I\) such that \(a \neq 0\) and \(a\) has the smallest norm among all nonzero elements of \(I\). We claim that \(I = (a)\).
        Let \(x \in I\). We can write \(x = qa + r\), where \(q, r \in R\) and either \(r = 0\) or \(N(r) \lt N(a)\).
        Since \(x \in I\) and \(a \in I\), we have \(qa + r \in I\). Therefore, \(r \in I\).
        If \(r = 0\), then \(x = qa \in (a)\). If \(r \neq 0\), then \(N(r) \lt N(a)\).
        This contradicts the choice of \(a\). Therefore, \(r = 0\) and \(x = qa \in (a)\).
        Hence, every element of \(I\) can be written as a multiple of \(a\), so \(I = (a)\).
        Therefore, every ideal in a Euclidean domain is generated by a single element, and hence a Euclidean domain is a principal ideal domain. \(\blacksquare\)

      <h2>Adjoining Element</h2>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Definition.}\) The \(\textit{polynomial ring}\) in the variables \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) with coefficients in \( R \), denoted \( R[x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n] \), is defined inductively by
        \[
          R[x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n] = R[x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{n-1}][x_n].
        \]
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Adjoining Elements.}\) We next show how to describe some interesting subrings and subfields of a given extension \( F \subset L \).
        Given \( \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \in L \), we define
        \[
          F[\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n] = \{ h(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) \mid h \in F[x_1, \ldots, x_n] \}.
        \]
        Hence \( F[\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n] \) consists of all polynomial expressions in \( L \) that can be formed using \( \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \) with coefficients in \( F \).
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Note. }\)Keep in mind that \(F[\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n]\) is a ring, not necessarily a field.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example let Let \(F = \mathbb{Q}\) and \(\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}]\) is not a field.
        We know that \(1 + \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}\in \mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}]\). However, we can see that
        \(\frac{1}{1 + \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}}\) is not in \(\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}]\).
      </p>
        <p>
        Let
        \[
          F(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) = \left\{ \frac{\alpha}{\beta} \mid \alpha, \beta \in F[\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n], \beta \neq 0 \right\}.
        \]
        Thus \( F(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) \) is the set of all rational expressions in the \( \alpha_i \) with coefficients in \( F \).
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Lemma. }\)\( F(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) \) is the smallest subfield of the field \( L \) containing \( F \) and \( \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \).
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof. }\) Let \(L\) be a field containing \(F\) and \(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n\).
        Firstly, we show that \( F(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) \) is a subfield of \( L \).
        Thus, to prove the lemma, we must show that if \( K \) is a subfield of \( L \) containing \( F \) and \( \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \), then \( F(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) \subseteq K \).
        This is what "smallest" means in the statement of the lemma.
        Suppose that \( K \subseteq L \) contains \( F \) and \( \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \).
        Since \( K \) is closed under multiplication and addition, it follows that \( p(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) \in K \) for any polynomial \( p \in F[x_1, \ldots, x_n] \).
        This shows that \( F[\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n] \subseteq K \). Then \( F(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) \subseteq K \) follows immediately, since \( K \) is a field.
        Since \( F(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) \) is a subfield of \( L \) containing \( F \), we get extensions
        \[
          F \subseteq F(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) \subseteq L.
        \]
        We say that \( F(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n) \) is obtained from \( F \) by adjoining \( \alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \in L \).

      <h2>Separable</h2>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Definition. }\)A polynomial \(f\in F [x]\) is separable if it is non-constant and its roots
        in a splitting field are all simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Theorem. }\)A nonzero polynomial in \(K[X]\) is separable if and only if it is relatively
        prime to its derivative in \(K[X]\).
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof. }\)We firstly show that if a nonzero polynomial in \(K[X]\) is separable, then it is relatively prime to its derivative in \(K[X]\).
        Suppose that \(f(x)\in K[X]\) is separable, then we have \(f(x) = (x - \alpha)h(x)\) for some \(\alpha\) in the extension of \(K\).
        Note that \((x - \alpha)\) is the distinct factor of \(f\) because of the definition of separable.
        In other words, \(h(\alpha)\neq 0\).
        Then we have
        \[
        \begin{align}
          f'(x) &= h(x) + (x - \alpha)h'(x). \\
          f'(\alpha) &= h(\alpha) + (\alpha - \alpha)h'(\alpha) = h(\alpha) \neq 0. \\
        \end{align}
        \]
        In that case, we can know that \(f\) and \(f'\) do not share the same root, which implies that
        they do not have the same factor. Hence, we have \(f\) and \(f'\) are relatively prime.
        For the other direction, we will prove it with contrapositive.
        Suppose that \(f(x)\) is not separable, given the definition of separable, we can know that \(f(x)\) has a repeated roots.
        Then we have \(f(x) = (x - \alpha)^2h(x)\) for some \(\alpha\) in the extension of \(K\).
        Hence, we can get
        \[
        \begin{align}
          f'(x) &= 2(x - \alpha)h(x) + (x - \alpha)^2h'(x)\\
          f'(\alpha) &= 2(\alpha - \alpha)h(\alpha) + (\alpha - \alpha)^2h'(\alpha) = 0. \\
        \end{align}
        \]
        Therefore, we can know that \(f\) and \(f'\) have some similar factor. Hence, we have \(f\) and \(f'\) are not relatively prime. \(\blacksquare\)

        <b>Problem 6.</b> Let \( A \) be the \( n \times n \) matrix over \( \mathbb{C} \) all of whose entries equal \(1\).
      </p>

        <li>(c) Let \( B \) denote the \( n \times n \) matrix over \( \mathbb{C} \) whose diagonal entries are 0 and all other entries are 1. Find the Jordan canonical form of \( B \).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>Solution (a).</b> Let \(A\) be the \(n \times n\) matrix over \(\mathbb{C}\) all of whose entries equal \(1\).
        Then, we can know that \(A^2 = nA\). Let \(e_1\) be the first standard basis vector in \(\mathbb{C}^n\).
        Hence, we have \(A^2\cdot e_1 - n\cdot e_1 = 0\). This implies that the minimal polynomial of \(A\) is \(x^2 - nx\).
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Solution (b).</b> Firstly, we factor the minimal polynomial of \(A\), which is \(x^2 - nx = x(x - n)\).
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Solution (c).</b> Let \(A_n\) to denote the \(n\times n\) matrix with all entries equal to 1.
        Then, we denote \(B_n\) as \(A_n - I_n\) where \(I_n\) is the identity matrix of size \(n\times n\).
        Let \(e_1\) to be the first standard basis vector in \(\mathbb{C}^n\).
        Then we have \(B\cdot e_1 = [0, 1, 1, \ldots, 1]^T\).
        Since \(B_n^2 = (A_n - I_n)^2 = A_n^2 - 2A_n + I_n = nA_n - 2A_n + I_n = (n - 2)A_n + I_n\).
        Hence, we can see that \(B_n^2\) is the \(n\times n\) matrix with all entries equal to \(n-2\) besides the diagonal entries are \(n - 1\).
        Then, we can get \(B_n^2 \cdot e_1 = [n-1, n-2, n-2, \ldots, n-2]^T\).
        Thus, we will get the following equations:
        \[
        \begin{align}
        (n-1)\cdot e_1 + (n-2)\cdot B_n\cdot e_1 &= B_n^2\cdot e_1 \\
        B_n^2\cdot e_1 - (n-2)\cdot B_n\cdot e_1 &- (n-1)\cdot e_1 = 0.
        \end{align}
        \]
        Therefore, we can have the minimal polynomial of \(B_n\) is \(x^2 - (n-2)x - (n-1)\).

      <b>Problem 5.</b> Let \( V \) be a finite dimensional vector space over the field \( F \) and \( T : V \to V \) is a linear transformation. Suppose that \( \chi_T(x) \), the characteristic polynomial of \( T \), factors as \( \chi_T(x) = p_1(x)^{f_1} \cdots p_r(x)^{f_r} \), where each \( p_i(x) \) is irreducible over \( F \).

      Then we have the minimal polynomial of \( T \) is \( p_1(x)^{e_1} \cdots p_r(x)^{e_r} \), where \( 1 \leq e_i \leq f_i \) for each \(i\). By the following theorem:

        <b>Theorem.</b>
        Let \( V \) be a finite-dimensional vector space, \( T \) an operator on \( V \), and assume the minimal polynomial of \( T \) is \( \mu_T(x) = p_1(x)^{e_1} \cdots p_t(x)^{e_t} \), where the polynomials \( p_i(x) \) are irreducible and distinct.
        For each \( i \), let
        \[
        V_i = V(p_i) = \{ v \in V \mid p_i(T)^{e_i}(v) = 0 \} = \text{Ker}(p_i(T)^{e_i}).

        Then each of the spaces \( V_i \) is \( T \)-invariant and
        \[
        V = V_1 \oplus V_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus V_t.

      <p>
        <b>Proof.</b> Since the characteristic polynomial of \( A \) is \( \chi_A(x) = \det(xI - A) \), which is a polynomial of degree \( n \) with variable \( x \).

        \(\textbf{Problem 6. }\) Consider the matrix \( A = \begin{bmatrix}
          0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
          -1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
          -2 & 0 & -1 & -2 \\
          1 & -1 & 0 & 0 \\
          \end{bmatrix} \), with entries in \( \mathbb{C} \).
        Find \( J \), the Jordan canonical form for \( A \) and an invertible matrix \( P \) such that \( J = P^{-1}AP \).
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Solution. }\)We firstly find the characteristic polynomial of \(A\).
        \[
        \chi_A(x) = x^4 -x^2 = x^2(x+1)(x-1) = (x - 0)^2(x - 1)(x + 1).
        \]
        Now we try to determine the minimal polynomial of \(A\), which leaves us two possibilities: \(x^2(x-1)(x+1)\)
        and \(x(x-1)(x+1)\).
        We plug in \(A\) to \(x(x-1)(x+1)\) and find that it is not the zero matrix. Thus, we have the minimal
        polynomial is the same as the characteristic polynomial.
        Hence, we have the Jordan canonical form of \(A\) is
        \[
        J = \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0 & -1 \\
        \end{bmatrix}.
        \]
        Now we calculate the eigenvectors of \(A\).
        Then we have the eigenvectors of \(A\) are \(v_1 = (0, 1, 1, -1)^T\) for eigenvalue \(1\),
        \(v_2 = (0, 0, 1, 0)^T\) for eigenvalue \(1\), \(v_3 = (1, 1, 0, -1)^T\) for eigenvalue \(0\).
        We need to find another column vector of \(P\). Suppose that it is \((a, b, c, d)^T\) such that
        \[
        A \begin{bmatrix}
        a \\
        b \\
        c \\
        d \\
        \end{bmatrix} = v_3 = \begin{bmatrix}
        1 \\
        1 \\
        0 \\
        -1 \\
        \end{bmatrix}.
        \]
        Then we have \((a, b, c, d)^T = (1, 2, 0, -1)^T\). Hence, we have a matrix such that
        \[
        B = \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
        2 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
        0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
        -1 & -1 & 0 & -1 \\
        \end{bmatrix}.
        \]
        Then, we calculate the determinant of \(B\) and find that it is not zero. Hence, we have \(P = B\), where \(A =
        P^{-1}JP\).

        (b) Suppose the matrix of \( T \) with respect to the standard basis is
        \[

        1 & 1 & 0 \\
        0 & 1 & 1 \\
        1 & 0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}.
        \]
        Prove that \( T \) is a normal operator and find an orthonormal basis \( B \) for \( \mathbb{R}^3 \) such that the matrix of \( T \) with respect to \( B \) has the form in part (a).
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Proof (a).</b> Given that the matrix is the linear operator \(T\) respect to the standard basis. We have
        \[
        \begin{align}
        T(e_1) = \alpha e_1, \\
        T(e_2) = \beta e_2 + \gamma e_3, \\
        T(e_3) = -\gamma e_2 + \beta e_3.
        \end{align}
        \]
        Then, we have the transpose \(\begin{pmatrix}
        \alpha & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & \beta & \gamma \\
        0 & -\gamma & \beta
        \end{pmatrix}\), which is the adjoint of the matrix of \(T\).
        Thus, we have
        \[
        \begin{align}
        T^*(e_1) &= \alpha e_1, \\
        T^*(e_2) &= \beta e_2 - \gamma e_3, \\
        T^*(e_3) &= \gamma e_2 + \beta e_3.
        \end{align}
        \]
        Now, let \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\), then we have
        \[
        \begin{align}
        T^*(T(v)) &= T^*(a\alpha e_1 + b\beta e_2 + b\gamma e_3 - c\gamma e_2 + c\beta e_3)\\
        &= T^*(a\alpha e_1 + (b\beta - c\gamma) e_2 + (b\gamma + c\beta) e_3)\\
        &= a\alpha T^*(e_1) + (b\beta - c\gamma) T^*(e_2) + (b\gamma + c\beta) T^*(e_3)\\
        &= a\alpha \alpha e_1 + (b\beta - c\gamma)(\beta e_2 - \gamma e_3) + (b\gamma + c\beta)(\gamma e_2 + \beta e_3)\\
        &= a\alpha^2 e_1 + b(\beta^2 + \gamma^2)e_2 + c(\beta^2 + \gamma^2)e_3\\

        \]
        For the other direction,
        \[
        \begin{align}
        T(T^*(v)) &= T(a\alpha e_1 + b\beta e_2 - b\gamma e_3 + c\gamma e_2 + c\beta e_3)\\
        &= T(a\alpha e_1 + (b\beta + c\gamma) e_2 + (-b\gamma + c\beta) e_3)\\
        &= a\alpha T(e_1) + (b\beta + c\gamma) T(e_2) + (-b\gamma + c\beta) T(e_3)\\
        &= a\alpha \alpha e_1 + (b\beta + c\gamma)(\beta e_2 + \gamma e_3) + (-b\gamma + c\beta)(-\gamma e_2 + \beta e_3)\\

      Hence, we can see that \(T^*(T(v)) = T(T^*(v))\) for any \(v\in \mathbb{R}^3\). Therefore, we have \(T\) is a normal operator. \(\blacksquare\)
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Proof (b).</b> Similar to part \((a)\), we have

        T(e_1) &= e_1 + e_3, \\
        T(e_2) &= e_1 + e_2, \\
        T(e_3) &= e_2 + e_3.
        \end{align}
        \]
        Then we have the adjoint of the matrix of \(T\) is \(\begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0 & 1 \\
        1 & 1 & 0 \\
        0 & 1 & 1

        Then we have
        \[
        \begin{align}

        T^*(e_2) &= e_2 + e_3, \\
        T^*(e_3) &= e_1 + e_3.
        \end{align}
        \]
        Now, set \(v = a e_1 + b e_2 + c e_3\), then we have
        \[
        \begin{align}
        T^*(T(v)) &= T^*(a e_1 + a e_3 + b e_1 + b e_2 + c e_2 + c e_3)\\
        &= T^*((a + b)e_1 + (b + c)e_2 + (a + c)e_3)\\
        &= (a + b)T^*(e_1) + (b + c)T^*(e_2) + (a + c)T^*(e_3)\\
        &= (a + b)(e_1 + e_2) + (b + c)(e_2 + e_3) + (a + c)(e_1 + e_3)\\
        &= (2a + b + c)e_1 + (a + 2b + c)e_2 + (a + b + 2c)e_3.
        \end{align}
        \]
        For the other direction,
        \[
        \begin{align}
        T(T^*(v)) &= T(a e_1 + a e_2 + b e_2 + b e_3 + c e_1 + c e_3)\\
        &= T((a + c)e_1 + (a + b)e_2 + (b + c)e_3)\\
        &= (a + c)T(e_1) + (a + b)T(e_2) + (b + c)T(e_3)\\
        &= (a + c)(e_1 + e_3) + (a + b)(e_1 + e_2) + (b + c)(e_2 + e_3)\\
        &= (2a + b + c)e_1 + (a + 2b + c)e_2 + (a + b + 2c)e_3.
        \end{align}
        \]
        Hence, we can see that \(T^*(T(v)) = T(T^*(v))\) for any \(v\in \mathbb{R}^3\). Therefore, we have \(T\) is a normal operator.

            Write down all possible Jordan canonical forms for a \( 5 \times 5 \) matrix \( A \) such that \( A^3 = 0 \) (the blocks should have non-increasing size down the diagonal. We work over complex numbers).

          <li>
            Let \(N\) be a nilpotent matrix over any field. Prove that \(I + N\) is diagonalizable if and only if \(N = 0\) (I is the identity matrix of the same size).

        </ul>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Solution 1.}\)
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof 2.}\)Suppose that \(I\) is an identity matrix and \(N\) is a nilpotent matrix.
        Hence, we know there exists a \(n\in\mathbb{N}\) such that \(N^n = 0\).
        If \(N = 0\), then we can know that
        \[
          I + N = I + 0 = I.
        \]
        Since \(I\) is a diagonal matrix, we can know that \(I + N\) is diagonalizable. To see that, just pick any invertible matrix \(P\).
        Then, we have \(PIP^{-1} = I\). Hence, we have \(I\) is diagonalizable. Now suppose that \((I+N)\) is diagonalizable.
        Then, there exists a diagonal matrix \(D\) and an invertible matrix \(P\) such that \(D = P^{-1}(I + N)P\).
        Then, we have
        \[
        \begin{align}
        P^{-1}(I + N)P &= D\\
        P^{-1}IP + P^{-1}NP &= D\\
        I + P^{-1}NP &= D\\
        P^{-1}NP &= D - I\\
        (P^{-1}NP)^n &= (D - I)^n\\
        P^{-1}N^nP &= (D - I)^n\\
        P^{-1}0P &= (D - I)^n\\
        0 &= (D - I)^n\\
        \end{align}
        \]
        Thus, we can see that \(D - I = 0\), which implies that \(D = I\).
        Hence, we have \(P^{-1}(I + N)P = D = I\).
        Then we have \(I + N = PIP^{-1} = I\). Therefore, we have \(N = 0\).\(\blacksquare\)

        <b>Question 5.</b> Find the Galois group of \( x^3 + x + 2021 \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \). (2021 = 43 × 47)
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Proof.</b> Firstly, we want to show that the polynomial is irreducible over \( \mathbb{Q} \).
        Given that the degree of the polynomial is degree \(3\). Suppose that it is reducible, then it can only be factored into a polynomial of degree \(2\) and a polynomial of degree \(1\).
        If it can be factored as a polynomial of degree \(1\), it means it has a root in \( \mathbb{Q} \).
        Since we know that \(p(x)\) is an irreducible polynomial over \( \mathbb{Q} \) if and only if it is an irreducible polynomial over \( \mathbb{Z} \).
        For the other direction, we can know that if it is reducible over \( \mathbb{Q} \), then it is reducible over \( \mathbb{Z} \).
        Then we can know that it has a root in \( \mathbb{Z} \). Now, suppose that \(a\) is a root of the polynomial, then we have
        \[
        \begin{align}
        a^3 + a + 2021 &= 0\\
        a^3 + a &= -2021\\
        a(a^2 + 1) &= -2021\\
        a(a^2 + 1) &= -43 \times 47\\
        \end{align}
        \]
        In \(\mathbb{Z}\), we can know that each number of prime factorization. Hence, we can know that \(a^2+1\) is either \(43\) or \(47\).
        Suppose that \(a^2 + 1 = 43\), then we have \(a^2 = 42\), which is not a perfect square. Hence, we have \(a^2 + 1 = 47\), then we have \(a^2 = 46\), which is not a perfect square.
        Hence, it is a contradiction. Therefore, we can know that the polynomial is irreducible over \( \mathbb{Z} \), which implies that it is irreducible over \( \mathbb{Q} \).
        Now, set \(f(x) = x^3 + x + 2021\), we take the derivative of \(f(x)\) and find that it is \(3x^2 + 1\).
        We try to see what the <b>GCD</b> of \(f(x)\) and \(f'(x)\) is. We will use the Euclidean algorithm to find the <b>GCD</b>.
        \[
        \begin{align}
        f(x) &= f'(x)\left(\frac13x\right) + \left(\frac23 x + 2021\right) \\
        f'(x) &= \left(\frac23 x + 2021\right)\left(\frac92x - \frac{54567}{4}\right) + \frac{110279911}{4}\\
        \frac23 x + 2021 &= \frac{110279911}{4}\left(\frac{8}{330839733}x + \frac{8084}{110279911}\right) + 0\\
        \end{align}
        \]
        Then we can know that the <b>GCD</b> of \(f(x)\) and \(f'(x)\) is \(1\). Hence, we can know that the polynomial is separable.
        Once, we know that \(f(x) = x^3 + x + 2021\) is separable, the galois group of \(f(x)\) over \( \mathbb{Q} \) is the galois group of the splitting field of \(f(x)\) over \( \mathbb{Q} \).
        Since there are three distinct roots in the splitting field of \(f(x)\) over \( \mathbb{Q} \), and there will be an automorphism that maps one root to another root.
        Hence, there are \( 6\) automorphisms in the galois group of \(f(x)\) over \( \mathbb{Q} \).

          \(\textbf{Problem 1.}\)A square matrix \( A \) is called \(\textit{aperiodic}\) if \( A^m = A^n \) for some integers \( m > n \geq 0 \) (by convention \( A^0 = I \)).

        <ul>
            <li>
              Prove that a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix \( A \) over the real numbers is aperiodic if and only if: \( A^2 = \pm A \) or \( A^m = I \) for some \( m > 0 \).
            </li>
            <li>
              Give an example of a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix \( A \) over the real numbers such that \( A^{2022} = I \) but \( A^m \neq I \) for any positive integer \( m \lt 2022 \).
          </li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof(1). }\) Let \( A \) be a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix over the real numbers.
        If \( A^2 = \pm A \), then we have \( A^4 = A^2 A^2 = (\pm A)(\pm A) = A^2\).
        If \( A^m = I \) for some \( m > 0 \), then we have \( A^{m+1} = A^m\cdot A = I\cdot A = A \), where \(m+1 > 1\).
        For the other direction, without loss of generality, given \(A^m = A^n\) where \(m\gt n\).
        If \(A\) is invertible, then we have \(A^{m-n} = I\) where \(m-n > 0\).
        Firstly, we show that if \(A\) is non-invertible, then we can know that of the eigenvalue is \(0\).
        Since \(A\) is non-invertible, we can know that \(\text{det}(A) = 0\).
        Then we know the characteristic polynomial of \(A\) is \(\chi_A(x) = \text{det}(A - xI)\).
        When we plug in \(x = 0\), then we have \(\chi_A(0) = \text{det}(A - 0I) = \text{det}(A) = 0\).
        In that case, we have \(0\) is an eigenvalue of \(A\). Now we know one of the eigenvalues is \(0\) and we assume that the other eigenvalue is \(\lambda\).
        In that case we can denote the \(\chi_A(x) = (x - 0)(x - \lambda) = x(x - \lambda)\).
        According to the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, we have \(\chi_A(A) = A(A - \lambda I) = A^2 - \lambda A = 0\).
        Then we have \(A^2 = \lambda A\), which implies that \(\frac{1}{\lambda}A^2 = A\). Given we have \(A^m = A^n\).
        We have
        \[
        \begin{align}
          A^n &=  (\frac{1}{\lambda}A^2)^n \\
          &= \frac{1}{\lambda^n}A^{2n} \\
        A^m &= \frac{1}{\lambda^n}A^{2n} \\
        \lambda^n A^m &= A^{n}A^n \\
        \lambda^n A^m &= A^{m}A^m\\
        \lambda^n A^m &= A^{2m}\\
        \end{align}
        \]
        At the same time, it is not hard to get \(A^{2m} = \lambda^mA^m\).
        Then we have \(\lambda^n A^m = \lambda^m A^m\), which implies that
        \[
          A^m(\lambda^m - \lambda^n) = 0.
        \]
        Then, we can know that \(A^m = 0\) or \(\lambda^m = \lambda^n\).
        It \(A^m = 0\), then we can know that \(A\) is nilpotent.
        We know that \(A\) is nilpotent, then we can know that \(A\) has only one eigenvalue which is \(0\). (need to be proved.)
        In that case, we have \(A^2 = 0 \). Then we can get that \(A = 0\) with conditions of \(\text{det}(A) = 0\).
        If \(\lambda^m = \lambda^n\), then we have \(\lambda^n(\lambda^{m-n} - 1)\). Again, if \(\lambda \neq 0\), then we have
        \(\lambda^{m-n} = 1\) where \(\lambda\in \mathbb{R}\). Then we have \(\lambda = \pm 1\). In that case, we have
        \(A^2 = \lambda A = \pm A\).\(\blacksquare\)
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Solution(2). }\) Let \( A = \begin{pmatrix} \cos(\frac{2\pi}{2022}) &  -\sin(\frac{2\pi}{2022}) \\  \sin(\frac{2\pi}{2022}) &  \cos(\frac{2\pi}{2022}) \end{pmatrix} \).
        Then we have \( A^{2022} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} = I \) and \( A^m \neq I \) for any positive integer \( m \lt 2022 \).

        \(\textbf{Problem 3. }\) Find the Jordan canonical form and a Jordan basis for
        \(
        A = \begin{pmatrix}
        2 & 2 & -1 \\
        0 & 3 & 0 \\
        1 & -2 & 4
        \end{pmatrix}.
        \)
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Solution. }\) Firstly, we calculate the characteristic polynomial
        \[
        \begin{align}
        \chi_A(x) &= \text{det}\left|
        \begin{matrix}
        x - 2 & 2 & 1\\
        0 & x-3 & 0\\
        -1 & x + 2 & x - 4\\
        \end{matrix}
        \right|\\
        &= -(x-3)((x-2)(x-4) + 1)\\
        &= -(x-3)(x^2 - 6x + 9)\\
        &= - (x - 3)^3
        \end{align}
        \]
        Now we try to identity the minimal polynomial, which only have two options for us: \((x - 3)^2\) or \((x - 3)^3\).
        When we plug in \(A = x\) to \((x - 3)^2\), we have \((A - 3)^2 = 0\).
        Hence, we have the minimal polynomial which is \((x - 3)^2\).
        Hence, we have the rational canonical form and Jordan canonical form
        \[
        R = \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & -9 & 0\\
        1 & 6 & 0\\
        0 & 0 & 3\\
        \end{pmatrix} \qquad
        J = \begin{pmatrix}
        3 & 0 & 0\\
        1 & 3 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 3\\
        \end{pmatrix}
        \]
      Since the minimal polynomial is \((x - 3)^2\), we want to find a vector \(v\not\in \ker(A - 3)\) as a maximal vector.
      We find out that \(v = (1, 0, 0)^T\), and we have the eigenvectors \((1, 0, -1)^T, (0, 1, 2)^T\).
      We calculate the \(A\cdot v= (2, 0, 1)^T\). In order to make basis, we will choose \(v, Av\). For the last vector, we will use an
      eigenvector which is linearly independent to \(v, Av\), which is \((0, 1, 2)^T\).
      Thus, the basis for the rational canonical form is
      \[
      P_C = \begin{pmatrix}
      1 & 2 & 0\\
      0 & 0 & 1\\
      0 & 1 & 2\\
      \end{pmatrix}
      \]
      Similarly, we can find the Jordan basis
      \[
      P_C = \begin{pmatrix}
      1 & -1 & 0\\
      0 & 0 & 1\\
      0 & 1 & 2\\
      \end{pmatrix}

      Hence, we have \(pR \subset I\). Since \(I\) is a prime ideal, it is proper and there are no proper ideals properly containing \(pR\).

          Then we have \(A = PBP^{-1}\) for some invertible \(n\times n\) matrices over \(\mathbb{C}\).
          Suppose the characteristic polynomial of \(A\) is \(\chi_A(x)\). Then we have
          Hence, we have
          \[
            \begin{align}
            \chi_A(x) &= \text{det}(xI - A)\\

            &= \chi_B(x).
            \end{align}
          \]
          Thus, we show that the characteristic polynomial of \(A\) and \(B\) are the same.
          Now we need to show that the minimal polynomial of \(A\) and \(B\) are the same.
          Suppose that the minimal polynomial of \(A\) is \(\mu_A(x):=(x-\lambda_1)^{e_1}\cdots(x - \lambda_m)^{e_m}\)
          and the minimal polynomial of \(B\) is \(\mu_B(x):=(x-\lambda_1)^{f_1}\cdots(x - \lambda_m)^{f_m}\).
          Then we have
          \[
            \begin{align}
            \mu_A(A) &= 0\\
            \mu_A(PBP^{-1}) &= (\lambda_1I - PBP^{-1})^{e_1}\cdots(\lambda_mI - PBP^{-1})^{e_m}\\
            &= (P\lambda_1IP^{-1} - PBP^{-1})^{e_1}\cdots(P\lambda_mIP^{-1} - PBP^{-1})^{e_m}\\
            &= P(\lambda_1I - B)^{e_1}P^{-1}\cdots P(\lambda_mI - B)^{e_m}P^{-1}\\
            &= P(\lambda_1I - B)^{e_1}\cdots(\lambda_mI - B)^{e_m}P^{-1}\\
            P(\lambda_1I - B)^{e_1}\cdots(\lambda_mI - B)^{e_m}P^{-1} &= 0\\
            (\lambda_1I - B)^{e_1}\cdots(\lambda_mI - B)^{e_m} &= P^{-1}0P = 0\\
            \end{align}
          \]
          Thus, we can know that \(e_i\geq f_i\) for \(i = 1, \ldots, m\). Similarly, we can know that
          \[

            &= (P^{-1}\lambda_1IP - P^{-1}AP)^{f_1}\cdots(P^{-1}\lambda_mIP - P^{-1}AP)^{f_m}\\
            &= P^{-1}(\lambda_1I - A)^{f_1}P\cdots P^{-1}(\lambda_mI - A)^{f_m}P\\
            &= P^{-1}(\lambda_1I - A)^{f_1}\cdots(\lambda_mI - A)^{f_m}P\\
            P^{-1}(\lambda_1I - A)^{f_1}\cdots(\lambda_mI - A)^{f_m}P &= 0\\
            (\lambda_1I - A)^{f_1}\cdots(\lambda_mI - A)^{f_m} &= P0P^{-1} = 0\\

          Thus, we can know that \(e_i\leq f_i\) for \(i = 1, \ldots, m\). Hence, we have \(e_i = f_i\) for \(i = 1, \ldots, m\).
          Therefore, we show that they share the same minimal polynomial.\(\blacksquare\)

          <b>Problem 5.</b> Let \( R \) be an integral domain with quotient field (i.e., field of fractions) \( K \). Let \( \mathcal{J} \) denote the collection of ideals \( (R : \alpha) \) such that \( \alpha \in K \), where \( (R : \alpha) := \{ r \in R \mid r\alpha \in R \} \). Show that \( R \) is a UFD if the following conditions hold (15 points):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The ideals in \( \mathcal{J} \) satisfy the ascending chain condition.

          <li>
            Every ideal in \( \mathcal{J} \) is principal.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          \(\textbf{Proof. }\)Firstly, given that \(R\) is an integral domain, \(\mathcal{J}\) satisfies the ascending chain condition implies that
          there is a maximal element in \(\mathcal{J}\) (i.e. a maximal ideal in \(\mathcal{J}\)). We also know that a maximal ideal is a prime ideal.
          For any principal ideal of \(R\), we can denote it as \(\langle r\rangle\) for some \(r\in R\) where \(r\neq 0\).
          Then, we can know that \(\langle r\rangle \subset (R, \frac{1}{r})\) since \(r\cdot \frac{1}{r} = 1\in R\).
          Hence, we can know that any principal ideal is contained in an ideal in \(\mathcal{J}\).
          Since every ideal in \(\mathcal{J}\) is principal, and it satisfies the ascending chain condition, we can know that
          the collection of principal ideals in \(R\) satisfies the ascending chain condition.
          According to \(\textbf{Proposition A}\), we can know it implies that every non-zero and non-unit element in \(R\) can be written as a finite product of irreducible elements.
          Now, suppose that \(\langle r\rangle \subset (R, \frac{1}{r})\). For any \(s\in (R, \frac{1}{r})\), we can know that \(s\cdot \frac{1}{r} \in R\).
          Then we have \(\frac{s}{r} = t\) for some \(t\in R\). Hence, we have \(s = tr\in \langle r\rangle \).
          Hence, we show that \(\langle r\rangle = (R, \frac{1}{r})\). Suppose that there is an ideal \(I\in \mathcal{J}\) such that \(\langle q\rangle \subset I\), where \(q\) is irreducible in \(R\).
          Since every ideal in \(\mathcal{J}\) is principal, we can know that \(I = \langle m\rangle\) for some \(m\in R\).
          Since \(q\in \langle m\rangle\), we can k
          now that \(q = rm\) for some \(r\in R\). Since \(q\) is irreducible, we can know that either \(m\) or \(r\) is a unit in \(R\).
          If \(m\) is a unit, then we have \(I = R\). If \(r\) is a unit, then we have \(I = \langle q\rangle\).
          Thus, we can know that \(\langle q\rangle \) is a maximal ideal in \(\mathcal{J}\).

        </p>
        <p>
          \(\textbf{Proof. }\) We will prove it with mathematical contradiction. Suppose that it is true that  \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})\) is contained in \(\mathbb{Q}(\epsilon)\) for some \(n\)th root of unity \(\epsilon \in \mathbb{C}\).
          Firstly, we know that \(\mathbb{Q}(\epsilon)\cong \mathbb{Q}/\Phi_n(x)\), where \(\Phi_n(x)\) is the \(n\)th cyclotomic polynomial. Since \(\Phi_n(x)\) is irreducible over \(\mathbb{Q}\), we can know that \(\Phi_n(x)\) is separable over \(\mathbb{Q}\) since any irreducible polynomial over a characteristic zero field is separable.
          Then, we can know that \(\mathbb{Q}(\epsilon)\) is a galois extension over \(\mathbb{Q}\).
          Since \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})\) is a subfield of \(\mathbb{Q}(\epsilon)\), we can know that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})\) is a galois extension over \(\mathbb{Q}\).
          The minimal polynomial of \(\sqrt[3]{2}\) is \(x^3 - 2\), which is irreducible over \(\mathbb{Q}\).
          However, we can know that \(x^3 - 2\) is not separable over \(\mathbb{Q}\) since it does not contain the complex roots in \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})\).
          Hence, we have a contradiction. Therefore, we can know that \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt[3]{2})\) is not contained in \(\mathbb{Q}(\epsilon)\) for any root of unity \(\epsilon \in \mathbb{C}\).\(\blacksquare\)

      \(\textbf{Problem 1.}\) Suppose that \(A\) is a square complex matrix such that \(A\) is similar to \(A^n\), for some \(n>1\).
      Prove that the eigenvalues of \(A\) are either \(0\) or roots of unity.
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof. }\) Suppose that \(\lambda\) is an eigenvalue of \(A\) and \(v\) is the corresponding eigenvector, and we
        want to show that \(\lambda^m\) is an eigenvalue for \(A^m\) for any \(m\in \mathbb{N}\). We can get
        \[
          \begin{align}
            A v &= \lambda v\\
            A^n v &= \lambda^n v\\
            A^{n^2} v &= \lambda^{n^2} v\\
            A (A^{m-1} v) &= \lambda A^{m-1} v\\
            &= A^{m-1}(\lambda v)\\
            &= \lambda A^{n-1}v\\
            &= \ldots \\
            &= \lambda^n v.
          \end{align}
        \]
        If \(A^n\) is similar to \(A\), then there exists an invertible matrix \(P\) such that \(A^n = P^{-1} A P\).
        We want to show that \(A\) is similar to \(A^{n^m}\) for any \(m\in \mathbb{N}\).
        \[
          \begin{align}
        A^{n^m} &= A^{nm}\\
        &= (P^{-1} A^n P)^{nm}\\
            &= (A^{n^{m-1}})^n\\
            &= (P^{-1} A^{n^{m-1}} P)^n\\
            &= P^{-1} A^{n^{m-1}} P P^{-1} A^{n^{m-1}} P \ldots P^{-1} A^{n^{m-1}} P\\
            &= P^{-1} A^{n^{m-1}} A^{n^{m-1}} \ldots A^{n^{m-1}} P\\
            &= P^{-1} A^{n^{m-1} + n^{m-1} + \ldots + n^{m-1}} P\\
            &= P^{-1} A^{n^m} P.
          \end{align}
        \]
        Hence, we can know that \(\lambda^n\) is an eigenvalue of \(A^n\) and its corresponding eigenvector is \(v\).
        Since we know that \(A\) and \(A^n\) are similar, we have \(\lambda^n\) is an eigenvalue of \(A\).

      \(\textbf{Problem 2.}\) Suppose \(A=
      \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & -1 & 3\\
        1 & -2 & 3\\
        0 & 0 & 2
        \end{pmatrix}
        \).  Calculate \(A^{2023}\).
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Solution. }\)We can get the characteristic polynomial of \(A\) is \(\chi_A(x)=(x - 2)(x+1)^2\).
      Now we need to find the minimal polynomial of \(A\). Given the characteristic polynomial of \(A\), we have two options
      for the minimal polynomial of \(A\), which are \((x-2)(x+1)\) and \((x-2)(x+1)^2\). Firstly, plug \(A\) into \((x-2)(x+1)\) and we have
      \[
        \begin{align}
          (A-2I)(A+I) &=
          \begin{pmatrix}
            -2 & -1 & 3\\
            1 & -4 & 3\\
            0 & 0 & 0
          \end{pmatrix}
          \begin{pmatrix}
            1 & -1 & 3\\
            1 & -1 & 3\\
            0 & 0 & 3
          \end{pmatrix}\\
          &=
          \begin{pmatrix}
            -3 & 3 & 0\\
            -3 & 3 & 0\\
            0 & 0 & 0
          \end{pmatrix} \\
          &\neq 0.
        \end{align}
      \]
      Then it leaves me the only option, which is \((x-2)(x+1)^2\). And we can know that the minimal polynomial
      is the characteristic polynomial, which implies that there is only one Jordan block for the eigenvalue \(-1\).
      Now we can get the Jordan canonical form of \(A\), which is
      \[
        J = \begin{pmatrix}
          -1 & 0 & 0\\
          1 & -1 & 0\\
          0 & 0 & 2
        \end{pmatrix}.
      \]
      Now we need to find the matrix \(P\) such that \(A=PJP^{-1}\).
      Firstly, we need to find the maximal vector of \(A\) for the eigenvalue \(-1\), which is in not in \(\ker(A + I)\).
      Then we get the columns of \(P\) as \(v, (A-2I)v = (1, 1, 0)^T, v_1\), where \(v_1\) is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(2\).
      Hence, we have
      \[
        P = \begin{pmatrix}
          1 & 1 & 1\\
          0 & 1 & 1\\
          0 & 0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}.
      \]
      And we can get \(P^{-1}\) as follows:
      \[
        P^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix}
          1 & -1 & 0\\
          0 & 1 & -1\\
          0 & 0 & 1
        \end{pmatrix}.
      \]
      Therefore, we have
      \[
    \begin{align}
      J &= P^{-1}AP = \begin{pmatrix}
        -1 & 0 & 0\\
        1 & -1 & 0\\
        0 & 0 & 2
      \end{pmatrix}. \\
      A^{2023} &= PJ^{2023}P^{-1}\\
      &= \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 1 & 1\\
        0 & 1 & 1\\

      \(\textbf{Solution (1). }\)The adjoint of \(T\) is the function \(T^*: V\to V\) such

      </ul>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Proof (3).}\) Suppose that \(T\) is normal. Then we have \(TT^*=T^*T\).
      Let \(v\in V\). Then we have
      \[
        \begin{align}
          \langle T^*v, T^*v\rangle &= \langle TT^*v, v\rangle\\
          &= \langle T^*T v, v\rangle\\
        \end{align}.
      \]
      Since we know that \((T^*)^* = T\), then we can get that \(\langle T^*T v, v\rangle = \langle T v, T v\rangle\).
      Since we have \(\langle T^*v, T^*v\rangle = \langle T v, T v\rangle\), we can get \(\|T^*v\| = \|T v\|\).
      For the other direction, suppose that \(\|T^*v\| = \|T v\|\) for all \(v\in V\). Then we have
      \[
        \begin{align}
          \langle T^*v, T^*v\rangle &= \langle T v, T v\rangle\\
          \langle T^*v, T^*v\rangle &= \langle TT^*v, v\rangle\\
          \langle T v, T v\rangle &= \langle T^*T v, v\rangle\\
          \langle TT^*v, v\rangle &= \langle T^*T v, v\rangle\\
        \end{align}.
      \]
      Now, we have to show that \(TT^*=T^*T\). For all \(v\in V\), we have
      \[
        \begin{align}
          \langle TT^*v, v\rangle &= \langle T^*T v, v\rangle\\
          \langle TT^*v, v\rangle - \langle T^*T v, v\rangle &= 0\\
          \langle TT^*v - T^*T v, v\rangle &= 0\\
          \langle (TT^* - T^*T) v, v\rangle &= 0\\
        \end{align}.
      \]
      Since for all \(v\neq 0\), we have \(\langle (TT^* - T^*T) v, v\rangle = 0\), we can get \(TT^* - T^*T = 0\), which implies that \(TT^*=T^*T\). \( \blacksquare \)

      \(\textbf{Solution(1). }\) We say that \(p\) is irreducible if \(p = ab\) where \(a, b\in R\), then either \(a\) or \(b\) is a unit.

    <p>
          \(\textbf{Solution(2). }\)Firstly, we want to show that \(3\) is irreducible in \(\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{-11})\).
          Let \(3 = (a + b\sqrt{-11})(c + d\sqrt{-11})\). Then we have
          \[
            \begin{align}
            3 &= (a + b\sqrt{-11})(c + d\sqrt{-11})\\
            &= ac - 11bd + (ad + bc)\sqrt{-11}\\
            \end{align}.
          \]
          Thus, we have \(ac - 11bd = 3\) and \(ad + bc = 0\).
          Similarly, we can have
          \[
            \begin{align}
            3 &= ac - 11bd - (ad + bc)\sqrt{-11}\\
            3 &= (a - b\sqrt{-11})(c - d\sqrt{-11})\\
            \end{align}.
          \]
          Then, we have
          \[
            9 = 3\cdot 3 = (a + b\sqrt{-11})(c + d\sqrt{-11})(a - b\sqrt{-11})(c - d\sqrt{-11}) = (a^2 + 11b^2)(c^2 + 11d^2).
          \]
          We can know that if \(b\neq 0\), then \(a^2 + 11b^2\geq 11\). Similarly, if \(d\neq 0\), then \(c^2 + 11d^2\geq 11\).
          Now we can conclude that \(b = d = 0\), which implies that \((ac)^2 = 9\). Hence, we have \(ac = \pm 3\).
          Since \(a, c\in \mathbb{Z}\), we can get that, without loss of generality, \(a = -1\) and \(c = -3\) or \(a = 1\) and \(c = 3\).
          Then, we show that \(3 = (-1)(-3)\) or \(3 = (1)(3)\), which implies one of the divisors is a unit.
          Hence, we can know that \(3\) is irreducible in \(\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{-11})\). \
          Then, we need to show that \(3\) is not prime in \(\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{-11})\).
          The first observation is that \(3\mid 12 = (1 + \sqrt{-11})(1 - \sqrt{-11})\).
          However, we can know that \(3\nmid (1 + \sqrt{-11})\) and \(3\nmid (1 - \sqrt{-11})\).
          Hence, we can know that \(3\) is not prime in \(\mathbb{Z}(\sqrt{-11})\).
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Proof (3). }\) Suppose that \(R\) is an integral domain, and \(p\) is a prime in \(R\).
      Then we can know that \((p)\) is a prime ideal in \(R\).
      If \((p)\) is a prime ideal, then for any \(a, b\in R\) such that \(p = ab\), we have \(a\in (p)\) or \(b\in (p)\)
      according to the definition of prime ideal. Without loss of generality, we assume that \(a\in (p)\).
      Then according to the definition of principal ideal, we have \(a = pr\) for some \(r\in R\).
      THen, we have \(p = ab= prb\), which implies that \(ar = 1\). Hence, we can know that \(a\) is a unit.
      In that case, we have for any \(ab = p\), either \(a\) or \(b\) is a unit. Therefore, we show that \(p\) is irreducible. \[ \tag*{$\square$} \]
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Proof (4). }\) Suppose that \(R\) is a principal ideal domain, and \(p\) is irreducible in \(R\).
      Let \(I\) to be any ideal containing \((p)\). Firstly, we can know that \(I\) is generated by some \(a\in R\) given
      \(R\) is principal ideal domain. Then we have \(I = (a)\) and \((p)\subset (a)\).
      Thus, we have \(p = ar\) for some \(r\in R\). Since \(p\) is irreducible, we have either \(a\) or \(r\) is a unit.
      If \(a\) is a unit, then \((a)\) is an ideal containing a unit, which implies that \((a) = R\). If \(r\) is a unit, then
      there exists \(u\in R\) such that \(ru = 1\). Then we have
      \[
      \begin{align}
        p &= ar\\
        pu &= aru\\
        pu &= a\\
      \end{align}.
      \]
      Thus, we have \(a\in (p)\), which implies that \((a) = (p)\). Thus, we have the only ideals containing \((p)\) are \((p)\) and \(R\).
      Therefore, we show that \((p)\) is a maximal ideal. Since \(R\) is a principal ideal domain, we know that
      \(R\) is an integral domain. Since every maximal domain is a prime ideal in an integral domain, we have \((p)\) is a prime ideal.
      Therefore, we have \(p\) is a prime in \(R\). \(\blacksquare\)

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Solution(1). }\) Firstly, we need to find the roots of \(p(x)\). We can get the roots of \(p(x)\) as follows:
      \[
        \begin{align}
          p(x) &= x^4 - 4\\
          &= (x^2 - 2)(x^2 + 2)\\
          &= (x - \sqrt{2})(x + \sqrt{2})(x - i\sqrt{2})(x + i\sqrt{2}).
        \end{align}
      \]
      Then, we can know that the splitting field \(K\) of \(p(x)\) over \(\mathbb{Q}\) is \(K = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, i)\).
      Firstly, we know that \([\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}): \mathbb{Q}]\) is 2 since \(x^2 - 2\) is irreducible in \(\mathbb{Q}\).
      \[
        [K: \mathbb{Q}] = [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, i): \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})][\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}): \mathbb{Q}]
      \]
      Since we can know that \(\mathbb{Q}\subset \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\), and we can know that \(x^2 + 1\) is irreducible in \(\mathbb{Q}[x]\)
      by using the Eisenstein's criterion with \(p = 2\). Thus, we can know that \([\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, i): \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})] \leq 2\).
      Thus, we only have two options: the degree is either 1 or 2. If the degree is 1, then we have \(i\in\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})\).
      Then we have \(i = a + b\sqrt{2}\) for some \(a, b\in\mathbb{Q}\). Then we have \(i^2 = -1 = (a + b\sqrt{2})^2\geq 0\), which is a contradiction.
      In that case, we can know that \([\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, i): \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})] = 2\). Therefore, we have
      \[
        [K: \mathbb{Q}] = [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, i): \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})][\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}): \mathbb{Q}] = 2\cdot 2 = 4.

        <li>
          Using the fact that \( A_5 \) has 44 elements of order 3 or 5 explain why the subgroups in (iv) are the only subgroups of order four.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Solution(1). }\)We firstly need to calculate the order of \(A_5\).
        We know that the order of \(S_5\) is \(5!\). Since we know that
        \[
          \frac{S_5}{A_5} = \{-1, 1\} = \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z},
        \]
        we can know that the order of \(A_5\) is \(5!/2 = 60 = 5\cdot 3\cdot 2^2\).
        Since \(2^2\not\mid 5\cdot 3\), we can know that any group of order \(4\) is a Sylow \(2\)-subgroup.
        According to the Sylow's theorem, we have the possible number \(n_2\) of Sylow \(2\)-subgroups is in the form of
        \[
          n_2 \equiv 1 \pmod{2} \text{ and } n_2\mid 15.
        \]
        Therefore, we have possible number of subgroups of order four is \(n_2 = 1, 3, 5, 15\).
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof(2). }\)Let \(H_1\) and \(H_2\) be two subgroups of order four.
        According to the Sylow's theorem, we have \(H_1\) and \(H_2\) are Sylow \(2\)-subgroups, and they
        conjugate to each other since they have the same order. Therefore, we have \(H_1\) and \(H_2\) are isomorphic.
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Solution(3). }\) We know there are two possible structures of subgroups of order four, which are
        \(V_4 \cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\) and \(\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}\).
        We can find one subgroup of order \(4\), which is
        \[
          H = \{e, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)\}\cong V_4.
        \]
        Since all subgroups of order \(4\) are isomorphic, we have all subgroups of order \(4\) are isomorphic to \(V_4\).
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Solution(4). }\)We can find five subgroups of order \(4\), which are
        \[
        \begin{align*}
          H_1 &= \{e, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)\}\\
          H_2 &= \{e, (12)(35), (13)(25), (15)(23)\}\\
          H_3 &= \{e, (12)(45), (14)(25), (15)(24)\}\\
          H_4 &= \{e, (13)(45), (14)(35), (15)(34)\}\\
          H_5 &= \{e, (23)(45), (24)(35), (25)(34)\}\\
        \end{align*}
        \]
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof(5). }\)We know that \(A_5\) has \(44\) elements of order \(3\) or \(5\).
        Since we show that every subgroup of order \(4\) is isomorphic to \(V_4\), we can know that the element of order
        \(3\) and order \(5\) cannot be in subgroup of order \(4\).
        Hence, there are \(60 - 44\ = 16\) elements to form subgroup of order \(4\). According to the Sylow's theorem,
        and we already found out there are \(5\) subgroups of order \(4\). In that case, the number of subgroup of order \(4\)
        is either \(5\) or \(15\). Now we want to show that for any two subgroups \(H_1, H_2\) of order \(4\), we only have two options:
        \[
          H_1\cap H_2 = \{e\} \text{ or } H_1 = H_2.
        \]
        There exists \(g\in G\) such that \(H_1 = gH_2g^{-1}\).
        Since \(h_1 \in H_1\), then we know that there exists \(h_2\in H_2\) such that
        \[
          h_1 = gh_2g^{-1}.

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Find, with proof, the kernel of the surjective ring homomorphism \(\phi : \mathbb{Z}[x] \to R\) taking \(f(x)\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) to \(f(\sqrt[3]{2})\) in \(R\).</li>
      <li>Find primes \(p, q \in \mathbb{Z}\) such that \(pR\) is a prime ideal and \(qR\) is not a prime ideal.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Solution 1. }\) We want to find the kernel of the surjective ring homomorphism \(\phi : \mathbb{Z}[x] \to R\).
      Since \(\ker(\phi)\) is the set of all polynomials \(f(x)\) in \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) such that \(f(\sqrt[3]{2}) = 0\), we have
      \[
        \ker(\phi) := \{f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x] \mid f(\sqrt[3]{2}) = 0\}.
      \]
      We know that \(x^3 - 2\) is the minimal polynomial of \(\sqrt[3]{2}\) over \(\mathbb{Z}\).
      Since \(x^3 - 2\) is irreducible in \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) by using the Eisenstein's criterion with \(p = 2\), we have
      \[
        \ker(\phi) = \langle x^3 - 2\rangle.
      \]
      \(\textbf{Proof. }\) For one direction, we want to show that \(\langle x^3 - 2\rangle \subset \ker(\phi)\).
      For any \(f(x)\in \langle x^3 - 2\rangle\), we have \(f(x) = (x^3 - 2)g(x)\) for some \(g(x)\in \mathbb{Z}[x]\).
      Then we have \(f(\sqrt[3]{2}) = ((\sqrt[3]{2})^3 - 2)g(\sqrt[3]{2}) = 0\). Hence, we have \(f(x)\in \ker(\phi)\).
      For the other direction, we want to show that \(\ker(\phi) \subset \langle x^3 - 2\rangle\).
      Since \(x^3 - 2\) is irreducible in \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\), and we can know that there is no polynomial with degree less than \(3\) in \(\ker(\phi)\).
      Since \(\mathbb{Z}\) is a Unique Factorization Domain by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, we can know that \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\) is a Unique Factorization Domain.
      Let \(f(x)\in \ker(\phi)\). Then we have \(f(x) = (x^3 - 2)g(x) + r(x)\) for some \(g(x), r(x)\in \mathbb{Z}[x]\) such that \(\deg(r(x)) \lt 3\).
      Hence, we have \(f(\sqrt[3]{2}) = 0 + r(\sqrt[3]{2}) = 0\), which implies that \(r(x) = 0\). Therefore, we have \(f(x) = (x^3 - 2)g(x)\), which implies that \(f(x)\in \langle x^3 - 2\rangle\).
      Therefore, we have \(\ker(\phi) = \langle x^3 - 2\rangle\). \(\blacksquare\)
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Solution 2. }\) We want to find primes \(p, q\in \mathbb{Z}\) such that \(pR\) is a prime ideal and \(qR\) is not a prime ideal.
      Since \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt[3]{2}] = \{a + b\sqrt[3]{2} + c(\sqrt[3]{2})^2 \mid a, b, c\in \mathbb{Z}\}\), we have \(\sqrt[3]{2}, \sqrt[3]{2}^2\in R\).
      Since \(\sqrt[3]{2}\cdot\sqrt[3]{2}^2 = 2\), and \(2\not\mid \sqrt[3]{2}\) and \(2\not\mid \sqrt[3]{2}^2\), we can know that \(2\) is not prime in \(R\).
      Since \(pR\) is a prime ideal if and only if \(p\) is a prime in \(R\), we can know that \(2R\) is not a prime ideal in \(R\).
      Now, we want to show that \(3\) is still prime in \(R\).
      Suppose that \(3 = (a + b\sqrt[3]{2} + c\sqrt[3]{2}^2)(d + e\sqrt[3]{2} + f\sqrt[3]{2}^2)\) for some \(a, b, c, d, e, f\in \mathbb{Z}\).

      \(\textbf{K-State 2022(1)}\) Let \( H \) be a subgroup of a group \( G \). Consider the subgroup
          \[ L = \{ (h, h) \mid h \in H \} \]
          of \( H \times G \). Prove that \( L \) is a normal subgroup in \( H \times G \) if and only if \( H \) is contained in
        the center of \( G \).
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Proof. }\)Firstly, we show that \( L \) is a normal subgroup in \( H \times G \) if \( H \) is contained in the center of \( G \) (i.e. \(Z(G)\)).
      Suppose that \(H\subset Z(G)\). Let \((h,g)\in H\times G\) and \((h', h')\in L\). Then
      \[
        \begin{align}
          (h, g)(h', h')(h, g)^{-1} &= (h, g)(h', h')(h^{-1}, g^{-1})\\
          &= (h, g)(h'h^{-1}, h'g^{-1})\\
          &= (h h' h^{-1}, g h'g^{-1})\\
        \end{align}
      \]
      Since \(H\subset Z(G)\), we have \(ghg^{-1}=h\) for any \(g\in G\). Thus, we have
      \[
        (h, g)(h', h')(h, g)^{-1} = (h h' h^{-1}, h h' h^{-1}) = (h', h')\in L.
      \]
      Hence, we show that \(L\) is a normal subgroup in \(H\times G\).
      Now we show that if \(L\) is a normal subgroup in \(H\times G\), then \(H\subset Z(G)\).
      Suppose that \(L\) is a normal subgroup in \(H\times G\). Let \(h\in H\) and \(g\in G\). Then
      \[
        \begin{align}
          (h, g)(h_1, h_1)(h, g)^{-1} &= (h_2, h_2)\\
        \end{align}
      \]
      for some \(h_1, h_2\in H\).
      Since \((e, g)\in H\times G\), we have
      \[
        \begin{align}
          (e, g)(h_1, h_1)(e, g)^{-1} &= (e, g)(h_1, h_1)(e, g^{-1})\\
          &= (eh_1e, gh_{1}g^{-1})\\
          &= (h_1, gh_1g^{-1})\\
          &= (h_2, h_2)\\
        \end{align}
      \]
      Hence, we can get \(h_1=h_2\). Thus, we have \(gh_1g^{-1}=h_1\) for any \(g\).
      Therefore, we show that \(H\subset Z(G)\). \(\blacksquare\)
