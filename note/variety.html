      <h2>Lie Algebra</h2>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Definition. }\) A vector space \(L\) over a field \(\mathbb{F}\), with an operation \(L \times L \rightarrow L\), denoted \((x, y) \mapsto [xy]\) and called the \(\textbf{bracket}\) or \(\textbf{commutator}\) of \(x\) and \(y\), is called a \(\textbf{Lie algebra}\) over \(\mathbb{F}\) if the following axioms are satisfied:
        <ul>
          <li>[(L1)] The bracket operation is bilinear.</li>
          <li>[(L2)] \([xx] = 0\) for all \(x \in L\).</li>
          <li>[(L3)] \([x[yz]] + [y[zx]] + [z[xy]] = 0\) \((x, y, z \in L)\).</li>
        </ul>
        Axiom (L3) is called the \(\textbf{Jacobi identity}\). Notice that (L1) and (L2), applied to \([x+y, x+y]\), imply anticommutativity: \((L2') [xy] = -[yx]\). (Conversely, if \(\operatorname{char}\mathbb{F} \neq 2\), it is clear that \((L2')\) will imply \((L2)\)).

      <h2>Root</h2>
      <p>
      Now fix a \(\textbf{maximal toral subalgebra}\) \(H\) of \(L\), i.e., a toral subalgebra not properly included in any other. (The notation \(H\) is less natural than \(T\), but more traditional.) For example, if \(L = \mathfrak{sl}(n, \mathbb{F})\), it is easy to verify (Exercise 1) that \(H\) can be taken to be the set of diagonal matrices (of trace 0).
      Since \(H\) is abelian (by the above lemma), \(\operatorname{ad}_L H\) is a commuting family of semisimple endomorphisms of \(L\). According to a standard result in linear algebra, \(\operatorname{ad}_L H\) is simultaneously diagonalizable. In other words, \(L\) is the direct sum of the subspaces \(L_\alpha = \{x \in L \mid [hx] = \alpha(h)x \text{ for all } h \in H\}\), where \(\alpha\) ranges over \(H^*\). Notice that \(L_0\) is simply \(C_L(H)\), the centralizer of \(H\); it includes \(H\), thanks to the lemma. The set of all nonzero \(\alpha \in H^*\) for which \(L_\alpha \neq 0\) is denoted by \(\Phi\); the elements of \(\Phi\) are called the roots of \(L\) relative to \(H\) (and are finite in number). With this notation we have a root space decomposition (or Cartan decomposition):
      \[
      L = C_L(H) \oplus \bigoplus_{\alpha \in \Phi} L_\alpha.
      \]
      When \(L = \mathfrak{sl}(n, \mathbb{F})\), for example, the reader will observe that \((*)\) corresponds to the decomposition of \(L\) given by the standard basis (1.2). Our aim in what follows is first to prove that \(H = C_L(H)\), then to describe the set of roots in more detail, and ultimately to show that \(\Phi\) characterizes \(L\) completely.

      <h2>Hyperplane</h2>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Definition 1. }\)A hyperplane in a vector space \( V \) is a subspace of codimension 1. In other words, a hyperplane is a linear variety of the form \( \{ v \in V : f(v) = 0 \} \) where \( f \) is a linear functional on \( V \).
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Definition 2. }\)The ambient space is \(n\)-dimensional Euclidean space, in which case the hyperplanes are the \((n-1)\)-dimensional flats, each of which separates the space into two half spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Example. }\)More generally, a hyperplane in \(\mathbb{P}_n\) is given by an equation 
        \[a_0x_0 + a_1x_1 + \dots + a_nx_n =0\]
        with \(a_i\in K \) not all zero.

        Fix a vector space \(V\) over \(\mathbb{R}\) with a nondegenerate positive definite inner product \((\cdot, \cdot)\). Define the \(\textit{reflection}\) relative to a nonzero vector \(\alpha \in V\) to be the linear transformation on \(V\) given by
        \[
        s_\alpha(v) = v - \frac{2(v, \alpha)}{(\alpha, \alpha)}\alpha.
        \]
        Note, \(s_\alpha\) maps \(\alpha\) to \(-\alpha\) and fixes the hyperplane perpendicular to \(\alpha\). Following the literature, we will use the notation
        \[
        \langle v, \alpha \rangle = \frac{2(v, \alpha)}{(\alpha, \alpha)}.
        \]
        so
        \[
        \alpha^* = \frac{2\alpha}{(\alpha, \alpha)}

        \[ \mathbf{x} \cdot \mathbf{y} = x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2 + \cdots + x_n y_n = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i. \]
      </p>

        \(\textbf{Remark. }\)In short, the Euclidean inner product is the dot product of two vectors.

    <section id = 'root_system'>
      <h2>Root System</h2>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Definition 1. }\)A subset \(\Phi\) of the Euclidean space \(E\) is called a root system in \(E\) if the following axioms are satisfied:
        <ul>
          <li>(R1) \(\Phi\) is finite, spans \(E\), and does not contain \(0\).</li>
          <li>(R2) If \(\alpha \in \Phi\), the only multiples of \(\alpha\) in \(\Phi\) are \(\pm \alpha\).</li>
          <li>(R3) If \(\alpha \in \Phi\), the reflection \(\sigma_{\alpha}\) leaves \(\Phi\) invariant.</li>
          <li>(R4) If \(\alpha, \beta \in \Phi\), then \(\langle \beta, \alpha \rangle \in \mathbb{Z}\).</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Definition 2. }\)A set \(\Phi\) of non-zero vectors (roots) in a Euclidean space \(E\) equipped with an inner product \(\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle\) forms a root system if it satisfies the following conditions:
        <ul>
          <li>Finite and spans \(E\): The set \(\Phi\) is finite, and the vectors in \(\Phi\) span the vector space \(E\).</li>
          <li>Non-zero multiples: If \(\alpha \in \Phi\), the only scalar multiples of \(\alpha\) that belong to \(\Phi\) are \(\alpha\) itself and \(-\alpha\).</li>
          <li>Reflection Symmetry: For each root \(\alpha \in \Phi\), the reflection \(s_\alpha\) in the hyperplane perpendicular to \(\alpha\) maps \(\Phi\) to itself. The reflection \(s_\alpha\) is defined by:
            \[
            s_\alpha(x) = x - 2 \frac{\langle x, \alpha \rangle}{\langle \alpha, \alpha \rangle} \alpha
            \]
            for any \(x \in E\).
          </li>
          <li>Integral Multiples: If \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are in \(\Phi\), then the projection of \(\beta\) onto \(\alpha\) is an integer multiple of \(\alpha\), specifically:
            \[
            \frac{2 \langle \beta, \alpha \rangle}{\langle \alpha, \alpha \rangle} \in \mathbb{Z}
            \]
          </li>
        </ul>
        This structure ensures that the reflections associated with the roots generate a group (the Weyl group), which acts on the vector space \(E\) by permuting the roots, thereby preserving the geometric structure of the root system.
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Definition 3. }\)
        Let \( E \) be a finite-dimensional Euclidean vector space, with the standard Euclidean inner product denoted by \( (\cdot, \cdot) \). A root system \( \Phi \) in \( E \) is a finite set of non-zero vectors (called roots) that satisfy the following conditions:
        <ul>
            <li> The roots span \( E \). </li>
            <li> The only scalar multiples of a root \( \alpha \in \Phi \) that belong to \( \Phi \) are \( \alpha \) itself and \( -\alpha \). </li>
            <li> For every root \( \alpha \in \Phi \), the set \( \Phi \) is closed under reflection through the hyperplane perpendicular to \( \alpha \). </li>
            <li> (Integrality) If \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are roots in \( \Phi \), then the projection of \( \beta \) onto the line through \( \alpha \) is an integer or half-integer multiple of \( \alpha \). </li>
        </ul>
        
        An equivalent way of writing conditions 3 and 4 is as follows:
        
        <ul>
            <li> For any two roots \( \alpha, \beta \in \Phi \), the set \( \Phi \) contains the element \( \sigma_{\alpha}(\beta) := \beta - 2 \frac{(\alpha, \beta)}{(\alpha, \alpha)} \alpha \). </li>
            <li> For any two roots \( \alpha, \beta \in \Phi \), the number \( \langle \beta, \alpha \rangle := 2 \frac{(\alpha, \beta)}{(\alpha, \alpha)} \) is an integer. </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, let up go through an example of a root system: \(A_2\). 
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Example. }\)Let \( V \) be the hyperplane in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) consisting of \(\{ (x_1, x_2, x_3) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid \sum x_i = 0 \}\) equipped with the usual inner product. Let \(\{ e_1, e_2, e_3 \}\) denote the standard basis for \(\mathbb{R}^3\). Let \( R = \{ \pm(e_1 - e_2), \pm(e_2 - e_3), \pm(e_1 - e_3) \} \). Then \( R \) is the root system of type \( A_2 \) (of rank 2) in \( V \). The set \( S := \{ \alpha_1, \alpha_2 \} = \{ e_1 - e_2, e_2 - e_3 \} \) is a basis of the root system \( R \). The Cartan integer \( \langle \alpha_i, \alpha_j \rangle \) is 2 or -1 according as to whether \( i = j \) or \( i \neq j \).
