      <h2>Hyperplane</h2>
      <p>
        A hyperplane in a vector space \( V \) is a subspace of codimension 1. In other words, a hyperplane is a linear variety of the form \( \{ v \in V : f(v) = 0 \} \) where \( f \) is a linear functional on \( V \).
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Example. }\)More generally, a hyperplane in \(\mathbb{P}_n\) is given by an equation 
        \[a_0x_0 + a_1x_1 + \dots + a_nx_n =0\]
        with \(a_i\in K \) not all zero.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fix a vector space \(V\) over \(\mathbb{R}\) with a nondegenerate positive definite inner product \((\cdot, \cdot)\). Define the \(\textit{reflection}\) relative to a nonzero vector \(\alpha \in V\) to be the linear transformation on \(V\) given by
        \[
        s_\alpha(v) = v - \frac{2(v, \alpha)}{(\alpha, \alpha)}\alpha.
        \]
        Note, \(s_\alpha\) maps \(\alpha\) to \(-\alpha\) and fixes the hyperplane perpendicular to \(\alpha\). Following the literature, we will use the notation
        \[
        \langle v, \alpha \rangle = \frac{2(v, \alpha)}{(\alpha, \alpha)}.
        \]
        so
        \[
        \alpha^* = \frac{2\alpha}{(\alpha, \alpha)}
        \]
        such that
        \[
        (v, \alpha^*) = (v, \alpha).
        \]

      <h2>Root System</h2>
      <p>
        A subset \(\Phi\) of the Euclidean space \(E\) is called a root system in \(E\) if the following axioms are satisfied:
        <ul>
          <li>(R1) \(\Phi\) is finite, spans \(E\), and does not contain \(0\).</li>
          <li>(R2) If \(\alpha \in \Phi\), the only multiples of \(\alpha\) in \(\Phi\) are \(\pm \alpha\).</li>
          <li>(R3) If \(\alpha \in \Phi\), the reflection \(\sigma_{\alpha}\) leaves \(\Phi\) invariant.</li>
          <li>(R4) If \(\alpha, \beta \in \Phi\), then \(\langle \beta, \alpha \rangle \in \mathbb{Z}\).</li>

      <h2>Simple Root</h2>
      <p>
        A root \(\alpha \in \Phi\) is called simple if it cannot be written as a sum of two distinct roots in \(\Phi\). The set of simple roots is denoted by \(\Pi\).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Positive Roots</h2>
      <p>
        A root \(\alpha \in \Phi\) is called positive if it can be written as a sum of simple roots with nonnegative coefficients. The set of positive roots is denoted by \(\Phi^+\).

      <h2>Cartan Matrix</h2>
      <p>
        The Cartan matrix \(A = (a_{ij})\) of a root system \(\Phi\) with respect to the basis \(\Pi\) is defined by
        \[
        a_{ij} = \langle \alpha_i, \alpha_j \rangle.
        \]
        And each entry \(a_{ij}\) is an integer and we call it the Cartan integer.

      <h2>Weyl Group</h2>
      <p>
        The Weyl group \(W\) of a root system \(\Phi\) is the group generated by the reflections \(\sigma_{\alpha}\) for \(\alpha \in \Phi\). The Weyl group is a finite reflection group acting on the Euclidean space \(E\).

      <h2>Dynkin Diagram</h2>
      <p>
        The Dynkin diagram is a graph with vertices indexed by the simple roots and the number of edges between \(a_i\) and \(a_j\) for \(i\neq j\) is \(\langle a_i, a_j\rangle\langle a_j, a_i\rangle\) with an arrow pointing to the smaller of the two roots if they have different lengths.

        Let \( V \) be the hyperplane in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) consisting of \(\{ (x_1, x_2, x_3) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \mid \sum x_i = 0 \}\) equipped with the usual inner product. Let \(\{ e_1, e_2, e_3 \}\) denote the standard basis for \(\mathbb{R}^3\). Let \( R = \{ \pm(e_1 - e_2), \pm(e_2 - e_3), \pm(e_1 - e_3) \} \). Then \( R \) is the root system of type \( A_2 \) (of rank 2) in \( V \). The set \( S := \{ \alpha_1, \alpha_2 \} = \{ e_1 - e_2, e_2 - e_3 \} \) is a basis of the root system \( R \). The Cartan integer \( \langle \alpha_i, \alpha_j \rangle \) is 2 or -1 according as to whether \( i = j \) or \( i \neq j \).

      \[ \mathbb{A}^n = \mathbb{A}^n(\overline{K}) = \{ P = (x_1, \ldots, x_n) : x_i \in \overline{K} \}. \]
      Similarly, the set of \( K \)-rational points of \( \mathbb{A}^n \) is the set
      \[ \mathbb{A}^n(K) = \{ P = (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \in \mathbb{A}^n : x_i \in K \}. \]

      <h2>Affine Variety</h2>
      <p>
      \(\textbf{Definition.}\) An affine algebraic set \( V \) is called an (affine) variety if \( I(V) \) is a prime ideal in \( \overline{K}[X] \). Note that if \( V \) is defined over \( K \), it is not enough to check that \( I(V/K) \) is prime in \( K[X] \). For example, consider the ideal \( (X_1^2 - 2X_2^2) \) in \( \mathbb{Q}[X_1, X_2] \).
