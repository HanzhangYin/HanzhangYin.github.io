      \(\textbf{Definition: }\)We say that \(a\) is congruent to \(b\) modulo
      \(m\) (in symbols , \(a\equiv b\; (\text{mod }m)\)) if and only if
      \(m\;|\; (a - b)\), where \(m > 0\).

      \(\textbf{Theorem 1. }\) \(a\equiv b\; (\text{mod }m)\) if and only if
      there is an integer \(k\) such that \(a =b+km\).
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Proof. }\)Suppose that \(a\equiv b\; (\text{mod }m)\). Then
      \(m\;|\;(a-b)\). Hence, there is an integer \(k\) such that \(a-b=km\).
      Thus, we can get \(a=b+km\). For the other direction, suppose that there
      is an integer \(k\) such that \(a=b+km\). Then we can get \(a-b=km\).
      Since \(k\) is an integer, we can get \(m\;|\;(a-b)\). Thus, we can get
      \(a\equiv b\; (\text{mod }m)\). \[ \tag*{$\square$} \]
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Note. }\)Theorem 1 can be used as the definition of congruence
      as well.

  <section id = "Theorem_2">  
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Theorem 2. }\) Every integer is congruent \((\text{mod }m)\) to
      exactly one of \(0, 1 , \dots, m-1\).
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Proof. }\)Write \(a=qm+r\),with \(0\leq r < m\). We know from
      previous theorem in \(\textbf{Euclid's Alogrithm}\) that \(q\) and \(r\)
      are unique. Since \(a\equiv r\; (\text{mod }m)\). \[ \tag*{$\square$} \]

  <section id = "The_least_residue">
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Definition: }\)We call the number \(r\) in the last theorem the
      least residue of \(a\; (\text{mod }m)\).
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id = "Theorem_3">
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Theorem 3. }\) \(a\equiv b\; (\text{mod }m)\) if and only if
      \(a\) and \(b\) leave the same remainder on division by \(m\). $$ a= bq+r.
      $$
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textbf{Proof. }\)Consider the set of integers \(\{a,a-b,a-2b,a-3b,
      \dots \}\). Since \(a\geq 0\), it contains a subset of nonnegative
      integers which is nonempty and bounded below by 0. According the
      least-integer principle, it contains a smallest element. Let be \(r = a -
      qb\) be the smallest integer which is larger than or equal to 0.
    </p>
    <p>\(\textit{Step 1. We show that \(r\) is less than \(b\)}\)</p>
    <p>
      We will prove it with mathematical contradcition. Suppose that \(r\geq
      b\). Then we can get $$ r = a-qb\geq b, $$ $$ a-qb-b\geq 0, $$ $$
      a-(q+1)b\geq 0. $$ Since \(0\leq a-(q+1)b < r\), \(r\) is not the smallest
      non-negative integer in the set. This contradicts the fact that \(r\) is
      the smallest non-negative integer in the set.
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\textit{Step 2. We show that \(r\) and \(q\) are unique}\) (i.e. \((q,
      r)\) is an unique pair)
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose there is another pair \((q', r')\) such that $$ a= bq +r = bq'+r',
      $$ with \(0\leq r< b\) and \(0\leq r'< b\). Hence, we can get that $$
      b(q-q') = r'-r. $$ Since \(q-q'\) is an integer and \(r'-r\) is an
      integer, we can get that \(b\) divides \(r'-r\) (i.e. \(b\;|\;(r'-r)\)).
      Since \(0\leq r< b\) and \(0\leq r'< b\), we can get $$ -b<-r\leq 0. $$
      Thus, $$ -b< r'-r< b. $$ Since \(r'-r\) is a multiple of \(b\), the only
      multiple of \(b\) between \(-b\) and \(b\) is \(0\). Hence, we can get
      that \(r'-r=0\), which implies that \(r'=r\). Since we know that \(b(q-q')
      = r'-r\), we can get \(b(q-q') = 0\). Since \(b\neq 0\), we can get that
      \(q-q'=0\), which implies that \(q=q'\). \[ \tag*{$\square$} \]
