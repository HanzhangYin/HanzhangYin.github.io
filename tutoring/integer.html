      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof: }\)We will prove it with mathematical contradiction. 
        Let \(S=\mathbb{Z}^+\) and we can know that \(S\neq\emptyset\). 
        According to the well-ordering principle, there exists an integer \(l\in S\) such that
        \[
        l\leq s\;\text{for all}\;s\in S.

        It means that 
        \[
        l\leq 1.

        Since \(l\in\mathbb{Z}^+\), we have
        \[
        l\cdot l\leq l\cdot 1 = l.
        \]
        Thus, we can get \((l\cdot l)\) is the smallest element of \(\mathbb{Z}^+\). The contradcition exists.

        Suppose \(S\) is nonempty and let \(k\) be its least element. 
        Since \(P(1)\) is true, \(1 \notin S\), \(1 \notin S\), so \(k \neq 1\). 
        Also, \(k-1\) is a positive integer, and \(k-1\lt k\), so \(k-1 \notin S\) for \(k\) is the least element of \(S\).
        So by definition, \(P(k-1)\) is true, but then by the property of \(P\) given above, \(P(k-1)\) being true implies that \(P(k)\) is true. 
        Thus, \(k \notin S\), yielding a contradiction. Therefore, \(S\) is empty, and \(P(k)\) is true for all \(k\). \[ \tag*{$\square$} \]

        \(\textbf{Definition. }\) Let \(\pi\) be a Gaussian integer.

        \(\textbf{Claim. }\)\(1+i\) is a guassian prime.
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof. }\)Since \(1+i\) is not a unit, we have to prove that if \(1+i=\alpha\beta\) for some \(\alpha, \beta\in\mathbb{Z}[i]\), then \(\alpha\) is a unit or \(\beta\) is a unit.
        Suppose that \(1+i=\alpha\beta\) for some \(\alpha, \beta\in\mathbb{Z}[i]\). 
        Then
        \[
        N(1+i) = N(\alpha\beta) = N(\alpha)N(\beta).
        \]
        Since \(N(1+i) = 2\) and norms are non-negative, we have \(N(\alpha) = 1\) or \(N(\beta) = 1\).
