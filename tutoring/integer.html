    <h2>Natural Number</h2>
      <p>
        Before we introduce Integers, we have to know what natural numbers are. 
        In order to build the natural number, we need to introduce two concept: 
        <ul>
          <li>
            \(0\),
          </li>
          <li>
            Successor Operation \(++\).
          </li>
        </ul>
        Right now \(0\) is just a notation, which has no meaning. We use \(n++\) to denote the successor of \(n\). 
        We can understand it as the next thing after \(n\). 
        For instance, we make an ordered list
        \[
        \{a, b, c, d\},
        \] 
        which has the order such that \(b\) is after \(a\), \(c\) is after \(b\), \(d\) is after \(c\).
        Hence, \(a++\) and \(b\) are the same and \(c++\) and \(d\) are the same.
        Moreover, \((a++)++\) and \(c\) are the same. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We use \(\mathbb{N}\) to denote the collection of all natural numbers. 
        In that case, \(\mathbb{N}\) is defined as a collection of \(0\) and everything
        which can be obtained from 0 by incrementing:
        \[
        \mathbb{N}=\{0, 0++, (0++)++, \cdots\}.
        \]

        \(\textbf{Proposition 5. }\)Every \(n\in\mathbb{Z}\) is even or odd.

      <p>
        \(\textbf{Proof. }\)We will prove it with two steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Step 1. }\)Every integer \(n\in\mathbb{Z}^+\) is even or odd. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We will prove it with mathematical contradiction. Let \(S=\{n\in\mathbb{Z}^+|n\;\text{is neither even nor odd}\}\)
        and suppose that \(S\) is not empty.
        According to <a href="#wop" class="tooltip-link">\(\textbf{Well-ordering Principle}\)
          <span class="tooltip-text">\(\textbf{Well-ordering Principle. }\)Every nonempty subset of \(\mathbb{Z}^+\) has a least element. 
          That is, if \(S\subset\mathbb{Z}^+\) and \(S\neq\emptyset\), then there exists an integer \(l\in S\) such that 
          \[
          l\leq s\;\text{for all}\;s\in S.
          \]</span>
        </a>
        <script src="position_adjust.js"></script>, we can know that \(S\) has a least element \(l\).
        Since \(1 = 2\cdot 0 +1\), we can know that \(1\) is odd. In that case, we can get that \(1\notin S\). 
        According to <span class="tooltip-text">\(\textbf{Proposition_5. }\)\(1\) is the least element of \(\mathbb{Z}^+\). </span>
      </a>
      <script src="position_adjust.js"></script>, we can know that \(l\gt 1\) since \(1\notin S\). 
        Thus, we can get \(l-1\in\mathbb{Z}^+\) for \(l-1\lt l\). Then we can get that \(l-1\) is even or odd.
        If \(l-1\) is even, then there exists an integer \(t\) such that
        \[
        l-1=2t.
        \]
        Then we can get
        \[
        l=2t+1,
        \]
        which means that \(l\) is odd. It is a contradiction. If \(l-1\) is odd, then there exists an integer \(t\) such that
        \[
        l-1=2t+1.
        \]
        Then we can get
        \[
        l=2t+2=2(t+1),
        \]
        which means that \(l\) is even. It is a contradiction. Therefore, we can get that every integer \(n\in\mathbb{Z}^+\) is even or odd.
      </p>
      <p>
        \(\textbf{Step 2. }\)There is no integer \(n\in\mathbb{Z}^+\) such that \(n\) is both even and odd.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will prove it with mathematical contradiction. Suppose that there exists an integer \(n\in\mathbb{Z}^+\) such that \(n\) is both even and odd.
        Then there exists an integer \(k, l\) such that
        \[
        n=2k=2l+1.
        \]
        Then we can get
        \[
        2k-2l=1,
        \]
        \[
        2(k-l)=1.
        \]
        Since \(k-l\in\mathbb{Z}\), we can get \(2\mid 1\). 
        According to <a href="#wop" class="tooltip-link">\(\textbf{Proposition 6}\)
        <span class="tooltip-text">\(\textbf{Proposition 6. }\)For \(a, b\in\mathbb{Z}^+\), if \(a\mid b\), then \(a\leq b\).</span>
        </a>
        <script src="position_adjust.js"></script>, we can know that \(2\leq 1\). It is a contradiction. 
        Thus, we can get that there is no integer \(n\in\mathbb{Z}^+\) such that \(n\) is both even and odd. 
        Therefore, we can get that every integer \(n\in\mathbb{Z}\) is either even or odd. \[ \tag*{$\square$} \]

        Since \(P(1)\) is true, \(1 \notin S\), \(1 \notin S\), so \(k \neq 1\). 
        Also, \(k-1\) is a positive integer, and \(k-1\lt k\), so \(k-1 \notin S\) for \(k\) is the least element of \(S\).
        So by definition, \(P(k-1)\) is true, but then by the property of \(P\) given above, \(P(k-1)\) being true implies that \(P(k)\) is true. 
        Thus, \(k \notin S\), yielding a contradiction. Therefore, \(S\) is empty, and \(P(k)\) is true for all \(k\). \[ \tag*{$\square$} \]

          \]
          where we set \(\alpha\overline{\beta} = m + ni\). Divide \(m\) and \(n\) by \(N(\beta)\) using the division algorithm
          in \(\mathbb{Z}\):
          \[
          m = N(\beta)q_1 + r_1, n = N(\beta)q_2 + r_2,
          \]
          where \(q_1\) and \(q_2\) are in \(\mathbb{Z}\) and \(0 \leq |r_1|, |r_2| \leq \frac{1}{2} N(\beta)\). Then
          \[
          \frac{\alpha}{\beta} = \frac{N(\beta)q_1 + r_1 + (N(\beta)q_2 + r_2)i}{N(\beta)} = q_1 + q_2i + \frac{r_1 + r_2i}{N(\beta)}.
          \]
          In that case, we can get the following:
          \[
          \alpha = \beta(q_1 + q_2i) + \frac{\beta(r_1 + r_2i)}{N(\beta)}=\beta(q_1 + q_2i) + \frac{\beta(r_1 + r_2i)}{\beta\overline{\beta}}.
          \]
          After a little algebra, we can get
          \[
          \alpha = \beta(q_1 + q_2i) + \frac{r_1 + r_2i}{\overline{\beta}}.
          \]
        </p>
          
          <p>
          Let \(\gamma = q_1 + q_2i\) (this will be our desired quotient), so after a little algebra the above
          equation becomes
          \[
          \alpha - \beta\gamma = \frac{r_1 + r_2i}{\overline{\beta}}.
          \]
          We will show \(N(\alpha - \beta\gamma) \leq \frac{1}{2} N(\beta)\), so using \(\rho = \alpha - \beta\gamma\) will settle the division
          theorem. Take norms of both sides of \(\alpha - \beta\gamma = \frac{r_1 + r_2i}{\overline{\beta}}\), where on the right side we use the norm
          on complex numbers and its multiplicativity (Remark 1.3). Letting \(z = \frac{r_1 + r_2i}{\overline{\beta}}\), so
          \[
            z\overline{\beta} = r_1 + r_2i,
          \]
          and 
          \[
          N(z) N(\overline{\beta}) = N(r_1 + r_2i) = r_1^2 + r_2^2.
          \]
          Since \(N(\beta) = N(\overline{\beta})\),
          \[
          N(z) = N(\alpha - \beta\gamma) = \frac{r_1^2 + r_2^2}{N(\beta)}.
          \]
          Since we know that \(0 \leq |r_1|, |r_2| \leq \frac{1}{2} N(\beta)\) by using the divison algorithm in \(\mathbb{Z}\), we have
          \(N(\alpha - \beta\gamma) \leq \frac{(\frac{1}{4} N(\beta))^2 + (\frac{1}{4} N(\beta))^2}{N(\beta)} = \frac{1}{2} N(\beta)\). \[ \tag*{$\square$} \]
